7</span>PICKWICKIAN MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.</h2>
<p>No English book has so materially increased the general gaiety
of the country, or inspired the feeling of comedy to such a 
degree as, &ldquo;The Pickwick Club.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is now some 
&ldquo;sixty years since&rdquo; this book was published, and it 
is still heartily appreciated.&nbsp; What English novel or story 
is there which is made the subject of notes and commentaries on 
the most elaborate scale; whose very misprints and 
inconsistencies are counted up; whose earliest &ldquo;states of 
the plates&rdquo; are sought out and esteemed precious?&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; wonderful to say, is the only story that 
has produced a literature of its own&mdash;quite a little 
library&mdash;and has kept artists, topographers, antiquaries, 
and collectors all busily at work.</p>
<p>There seems to be some mystery, almost <!-- page 8--><a 
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>miracle, 
here.&nbsp; A young fellow of four-and-twenty throws off, or 
rather &ldquo;rattles off,&rdquo; in the exuberance of his 
spirits, a never-flagging series of incidents and 
characters.&nbsp; The story is read, devoured, absorbed, all over
the world, and now, sixty years after its appearance, new and yet
newer editions are being issued.&nbsp; All the places alluded to 
and described in the book have in their turn been lifted into 
fame, and there are constantly appearing in magazines illustrated
articles on &ldquo;Rochester and Dickens,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dickens 
Land,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dickens&rsquo; London,&rdquo; and the 
rest.&nbsp; Wonderful!&nbsp; People, indeed, seem never to tire 
of the subject&mdash;the same topics are taken up over and over 
again.&nbsp; The secret seems to be that the book was a living 
thing, and still lives.&nbsp; It is, moreover, perhaps the best, 
most accurate picture of character and manners that are quite 
gone by: in it the meaning and significance of old buildings, old
inns, old churches, and old towns are reached, and interpreted in
most interesting <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>fashion; the humour, bubbling over, 
and never forced, and always fresh, is sustained through some six
hundred closely-printed pages; all which, in itself, is a marvel 
and unapproached.&nbsp; It is easy, however, to talk of the 
boisterousness, the &ldquo;caricature,&rdquo; the unlicensed 
recklessness of the book, the lack of restraint, the defiance of 
the probabilities.&nbsp; It is popular and acceptable all the 
same.&nbsp; But there is one test which incontestably proves its 
merit, and supplies its title, to be considered all but 
&ldquo;monumental.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is its prodigious fertility 
and suggestiveness.</p>
<p>At this moment a review is being made of the long Victorian 
Age, and people are reckoning up the wonderful changes in life 
and manners that have taken place within the past sixty 
years.&nbsp; These have been so imperceptibly made that they are 
likely to escape our ken, and the eye chiefly settles on some few
of the more striking and monumental kind, such as the 
introduction of railways, of ocean steamships, electricity, <!-- 
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>and the like.&nbsp; But no standard of comparison could 
be more useful or more compendious than the immortal chronicle of
<span class="smcap">Pickwick</span>, in which the old life, not 
forgotten by some of us, is summarised with the completeness of a
history.&nbsp; The reign of Pickwick, like that of the sovereign,
began some sixty years ago.&nbsp; Let us recall some of these 
changes.</p>
<p>To begin: We have now no arrest for debt, with the attendant 
sponging-houses, Cursitor Street, sheriffs&rsquo; officers, and 
bailiffs; and no great Fleet Prison, Marshalsea, or King&rsquo;s 
Bench for imprisoning debtors.&nbsp; There are no polling days 
and hustings, with riotous proceedings, or 
&ldquo;hocussing&rdquo; of voters; and no bribery on a splendid 
scale.</p>
<p>Drinking and drunkenness in society have quite gone out of 
fashion.&nbsp; Gentlemen at a country house rarely or never come 
up from dinner, or return from a cricket match, in an almost 
&ldquo;beastly&rdquo; state of intoxication; and &ldquo;cold 
punch&rdquo; is not very constantly drunk <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>through the 
day.&nbsp; There are no elopements now in chaises and four, like 
Miss Wardle&rsquo;s, with headlong pursuit in other chaises and 
four; nor are special licenses issued at a moment&rsquo;s notice 
to help clandestine marriages.&nbsp; There is now no frequenting 
of taverns and &ldquo;free and easies&rdquo; by gentlemen, at the
&ldquo;Magpie and Stump&rdquo; and such places, nor do persons of
means take up their residence at houses like the &ldquo;George 
and Vulture&rdquo; in the City.&nbsp; No galleried inns (though 
one still lingers on in Holborn), are there, at which travellers 
put up: there were then nearly a dozen, in the Borough and 
elsewhere.&nbsp; There are no coaches on the great roads, no 
guards and bulky drivers; no gigs with hoods, called 
&ldquo;cabs,&rdquo; with the driver&rsquo;s seat next his fare; 
no &ldquo;hackney coaches,&rdquo; no &ldquo;Hampstead 
stages,&rdquo; no &ldquo;Stanhopes&rdquo; or &ldquo;guillotined 
cabriolets&rdquo;&mdash;whatever they were&mdash;or 
&ldquo;mail-carts,&rdquo; the &ldquo;pwettiest thing&rdquo; 
driven by gentlemen.&nbsp; And there are no &ldquo;sedan 
chairs&rdquo; to take Mrs. Dowler home.&nbsp; <!-- page 12--><a 
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>There are no 
&ldquo;poke&rdquo; or &ldquo;coal-scuttle&rdquo; bonnets, such as
the Miss Wardles wore; no knee-breeches and gaiters; no 
&ldquo;tights,&rdquo; with silk stockings and pumps for evening 
wear; no big low-crowned hats, no striped vests for valets, and, 
above all, no gorgeous &ldquo;uniforms,&rdquo; light blue, 
crimson, and gold, or &ldquo;orange plush,&rdquo; such as were 
worn by the Bath gentlemen&rsquo;s gentlemen.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Thunder and lightning&rdquo; shirt buttons, &ldquo;mosaic 
studs&rdquo;&mdash;whatever they were&mdash;are things of the 
past.&nbsp; They are all gone.&nbsp; Gone too is 
&ldquo;half-price&rdquo; at the theatres.&nbsp; At Bath, the 
&ldquo;White Hart&rdquo; has disappeared with its waiters dressed
so peculiarly&mdash;&ldquo;like Westminster boys.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
have no serjeants now like Buzfuz or Snubbin: their Inn is 
abolished, and so are all the smaller Inns&mdash;Clement&rsquo;s 
or Clifford&rsquo;s&mdash;where the queer client lived.&nbsp; 
Neither are valentines in high fashion.&nbsp; Chatham Dockyard, 
with its hierarchy, &ldquo;the Clubbers,&rdquo; and the rest, has
been closed.&nbsp; No one now gives 
<i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;n&eacute;s</i>, not <!-- page 13--><a 
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span><i>d&eacute;jeuners</i>; or &ldquo;public 
breakfasts,&rdquo; such as the authoress of the &ldquo;Expiring 
Frog&rdquo; gave.&nbsp; The &ldquo;delegates&rdquo; have been 
suppressed, and Doctors&rsquo; Commons itself is levelled to the 
ground.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Fox under the Hill&rdquo; has given 
place to a great hotel.&nbsp; The old familiar &ldquo;White Horse
Cellars&rdquo; has been rebuilt, made into shops and a 
restaurant.&nbsp; There are no &ldquo;street keepers&rdquo; now, 
but the London Police.&nbsp; The <i>Eatanswill Gazette</i> and 
its scurrilities are not tolerated.&nbsp; Special constables are 
rarely heard of, and appear only to be laughed at: their staves, 
tipped with a brass crown, are sold as curios.&nbsp; Turnpikes, 
which are found largely in &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; have been 
suppressed.&nbsp; The abuses of protracted litigation in Chancery
and other Courts have been reformed.&nbsp; No papers are 
&ldquo;filed at the Temple&rdquo;&mdash;whatever that 
meant.&nbsp; The Pound, as an incident of village correction has,
all but a few, disappeared.</p>
<p>Then for the professional classes, which <!-- page 14--><a 
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>are described
in the chronicle with such graphic power and vivacity.&nbsp; As 
at this time &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; drew the essential elements of 
character instead of the more superficial ones&mdash;his later 
practice&mdash;there is not much change to be noted.&nbsp; We 
have the medical life exhibited by Bob Sawyer and his friends; 
the legal world in Court and chambers&mdash;judges, counsel, and 
solicitors&mdash;are all much as they are now.&nbsp; Sir Frank 
Lockwood has found this subject large enough for treatment in his
little volume, &ldquo;The Law and Lawyers of 
Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be thought that no judge of the 
pattern of Stareleigh could be found now, but we could name 
recent performances in which incidents such as, &ldquo;Is your 
name Nathaniel Daniel or Daniel Nathaniel?&rdquo; have been 
repeated.&nbsp; Neither has the blustering of Buzfuz or his 
sophistical plaintiveness wholly gone by.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;cloth&rdquo; was represented by the powerful but revolting
sketch of Stiggins, which, it is strange, was not resented by the
Dissenters of the <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>day, and also by a more worthy 
specimen in the person of the clergyman at Dingley Dell.&nbsp; 
There are the mail-coach drivers, with the &ldquo;ostlers, boots,
countrymen, gamekeepers, peasants, and others,&rdquo; as they 
have it in the play-bills.&nbsp; Truly admirable, and excelling 
the rest, are &ldquo;Boz&rsquo;s&rdquo; sketches&mdash;actually 
&ldquo;living pictures&rdquo;&mdash;of the fashionable footmen at
Bath, beside which the strokes in that diverting piece 
&ldquo;High Life below Stairs&rdquo; seem almost flat.&nbsp; The 
simperings of these gentry, their airs and conceit, we may be 
sure, obtain now.&nbsp; Once coming out of a Theatre, at some 
fashionable performance, through a long lane of tall menials, one
fussy aristocrat pushed one of them out of his way.&nbsp; The 
menial contemptuously pushed him back.&nbsp; The other in a rage 
said, &ldquo;How dare you?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know, I&rsquo;m 
the Earl of ---&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other 
coldly, &ldquo;If you <i>be</i> a Hearl, can&rsquo;t you 
be&rsquo;ave as sich?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the wedding at Manor Farm we find <!-- page 16--><a 
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>that bride 
and bridegroom did not set off from the house on a wedding tour, 
but remained for the night.&nbsp; This seemed to be the 
custom.&nbsp; Kissing, too, on the Pickwickian principles, would 
not now, to such an extent, be tolerated.&nbsp; There is an 
enormous amount in the story.&nbsp; The amorous Tupman had 
scarcely entered the hall of a strange house when he began 
osculatory attempts on the lips of one of the maids; and when Mr.
Pickwick and his friends called on Mr. Winkle, sen., at 
Birmingham, Bob Sawyer made similar playful efforts&mdash;being 
called an &ldquo;odous creetur&rdquo; by the lady.&nbsp; In fact,
the custom seemed to be to kiss when and wherever you could 
conveniently.&nbsp; Getting drunk after any drinking, and at any 
time of the day, seemed to be common enough.&nbsp; There was a 
vast amount of open fields, &amp;c., about London which 
engendered the &ldquo;Cockney sportsman.&rdquo;&nbsp; He 
disappeared as the fields were built over.&nbsp; We have no <!-- 
page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
17</span>longer the peculiar &ldquo;stand-up&rdquo; collars, or 
&ldquo;gills,&rdquo; and check neck-cloths.</p>
<p>But Mr. Bantam&rsquo;s costume at the Bath Assembly, shows the
most startling change.&nbsp; Where is now the &ldquo;gold eye 
glass?&rdquo;&mdash;we know that eye glass, which was of a solid 
sort, not fixed on the nose, but held to the eye&mdash;a 
&ldquo;quizzing glass,&rdquo; and folding up on a 
hinge&mdash;&ldquo;a broad black ribbon&rdquo; too; the 
&ldquo;gold snuffbox;&rdquo; gold rings &ldquo;innumerable&rdquo;
on the fingers, and &ldquo;a diamond pin&rdquo; on his 
&ldquo;shirt frill,&rdquo; a &ldquo;curb chain&rdquo; with large 
gold seals hanging from his waistcoat&mdash;(a &ldquo;curb 
chain&rdquo; proper was then a little thin chain finely wrought, 
of very close links.)&nbsp; Then there was the &ldquo;pliant 
ebony cane, with a heavy gold top.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ebony, however, 
is not pliant, but the reverse&mdash;black was the word 
intended.&nbsp; Then those &ldquo;smalls&rdquo; and stockings to 
match.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick, a privileged man, appeared on this 
occasion, indeed always, in his favourite white breeches and 
gaiters.&nbsp; In fact, on no occasion save one, <!-- page 
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>when 
he wore a great-coat, does he appear without them.&nbsp; 
Bantam&rsquo;s snuff was &ldquo;Prince&rsquo;s mixture,&rdquo; so
named after the Regent, and his scent &ldquo;<i>Bouquet du 
Roi</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Prince&rsquo;s mixture&rdquo; is 
still made, but &ldquo;<i>Bouquet du Roi</i>&rdquo; is 
supplanted.</p>
<p>Perker&rsquo;s dress is also that of the stage attorney, as we
have him now, and recognize him.&nbsp; He would not be the 
attorney without that dress.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;all in black, 
with boots as shiny as his eyes, <i>a low white neckcloth</i>, 
and a <i>clean</i> shirt with a frill to it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, 
of course, meant that he put on one every day, and is yet a 
slight point of contact with Johnson, who described someone as 
being only able to go out &ldquo;on clean shirt days;&rdquo; a 
gold watch and seals depended from his <i>Fob</i>.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Depended&rdquo; is a curious use of the word, and quite 
gone out.</p>
<p>Another startling change is in the matter of duels.&nbsp; The 
duels in Pickwick come about quite as a matter of course, and as 
a common social incident.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;forties&rdquo; I 
recall a <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>military uncle of my own&mdash;a 
gentleman, like uncle Toby&mdash;handing his card to some one in 
a billiard room, with a view to &ldquo;a meeting.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Dickens&rsquo; friend Forster was at one time &ldquo;going 
out&rdquo; with another gentleman.&nbsp; Mr. Lang thinks that 
duelling was prohibited about 1844, and &ldquo;Courts of 
Honour&rdquo; substituted.&nbsp; But the real cause was the duel 
between Colonel Fawcett and Lieut. Munro, brothers-in-law, when 
the former was killed.&nbsp; This, and some other tragedies of 
the kind, shocked the public.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Courts of 
Honour,&rdquo; of course, only affected military men.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick, himself, had nearly &ldquo;gone out&rdquo; on 
two or three occasions, once with Mr. Slammer, once with Mr. 
Magnus; while his scuffle with Tupman would surely have led to 
one.&nbsp; Winkle, presumed to be a coward, had no less than 
three &ldquo;affairs&rdquo; on his hands: one with Slammer, one 
with Dowler, and one with Bob Sawyer.&nbsp; At Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s
Party, the two medical students, <!-- page 20--><a 
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>tendered 
their cards.&nbsp; For so amiable a man, Mr. Pickwick had some 
extraordinary failings.&nbsp; He seems to have had no restraint 
where drink was in the case, and was hopelessly drunk about six 
times&mdash;on three occasions, at least, he was preparing to 
assault violently.&nbsp; He once <i>hurled an inkstand</i>; he 
once struck a person; once challenged his friend to &ldquo;come 
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet the capital comedy spirit of the author 
carries us over these blemishes.</p>
<p>When Sam was relating to his master the story of the sausage 
maker&rsquo;s disappearance, Mr. Pickwick, horrified, asked had 
he been &ldquo;Burked?&rdquo;&nbsp; There <i>Boz</i> might have 
repeated his apologetic footnote, on Jingle&rsquo;s share in the 
Revolution of 1830.&nbsp; &ldquo;A remarkable instance of his 
force of prophetic imagination, etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the sausage
story was related in the year of grace 1827, and Burke was 
executed in 1829, some two years later.</p>
<p>Mr. Lang has suggested that the bodies Mr. Sawyer and his 
friend subscribed for, <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>were &ldquo;snatched,&rdquo; but he 
forgets that this traffic was a secret one, and the bodies were 
brought to the private residence of the physicians, the only safe
way (<i>Vide</i> the memoirs of Sir A. Cooper).&nbsp; At a great 
public Hospital the practice would be impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot elder wine, well qualified with brandy and 
spice,&rdquo; is a drink that would not now be accepted with 
enthusiasm at the humblest wedding, even in the rural districts: 
we are assured that sound &ldquo;was the sleep and pleasant were 
the dreams that followed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which is not so 
certain.&nbsp; The cake was cut and &ldquo;passed through the 
ring,&rdquo; also an exploded custom, whatever its meaning 
was.&nbsp; In what novel now-a-days would there be an allusion to
&ldquo;Warren&rsquo;s blacking,&rdquo; or to 
&ldquo;Rowland&rsquo;s oil,&rdquo; which was, of course, their 
famous &ldquo;Macassar.&rdquo;&nbsp; These articles, however, may
still be procured, and to that oil we owe the familiar 
interposing towel or piece of embroidery the 
&ldquo;antimacassar,&rdquo; devised to protect the sofa or easy 
chair from the <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>unguent of the hair.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Moral pocket handkerchiefs,&rdquo; for teaching religion 
to natives of the West Indies, combining amusement with 
instruction, &ldquo;blending select tales with woodcuts,&rdquo; 
are no longer used.</p>
<p>Old Temple Bar has long since disappeared, so has the Holborn 
Valley.&nbsp; The Fleet was pulled down about ten years after 
Pickwick, but imprisonment for debt continued until 1860 or 
so.&nbsp; Indeed Mr. Lang seems to think it still goes on, for he
says it is now &ldquo;disguised as imprisonment for contempt of 
Court.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a mistake.&nbsp; In the County Courts
when small debts under &pound;3 10s. are sued for, the judge will
order a small weekly sum to be paid in discharge; in case of 
failure to pay, he will punish the disobedience by duress not 
exceeding fifteen days&mdash;a wholly different thing from 
imprisonment for debt.</p>
<p>Where now are the <i>Pewter Pots</i>, and the pot boy with his
strap of &ldquo;pewters?&rdquo;&mdash;we would have to search for
them now.&nbsp; Long <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>cut glasses have taken their 
place.&nbsp; Where, too, is the invariable Porter, drunk almost 
exclusively in Pickwick?&nbsp; Bass had not then made its great 
name.&nbsp; There is no mention of Billiard tables, but much 
about Skittles and Bagatelle, which were the pastimes at 
Taverns.</p>
<p>Then the Warming Pan!&nbsp; Who now &ldquo;does trouble 
himself about the Warming Pan?&rdquo;&mdash;which is yet &ldquo;a
harmless necessary and I will add a comforting article of 
domestic furniture.&rdquo;&nbsp; Observe <i>necessary</i>, as 
though every family had it as an article of their &ldquo;domestic
furniture.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is odd to think of Mary going round 
all the beds in the house, and deftly introducing this 
&ldquo;article&rdquo; between the sheets.&nbsp; Or was it only 
for the old people: or in chilly weather merely?&nbsp; On these 
points we must be unsatisfied.&nbsp; The practice, however, 
points to a certain effeminacy&mdash;the average person of our 
day would not care to have his bed so treated&mdash;with invalids
the &ldquo;Hot Water Bottle&rdquo; has <!-- page 24--><a 
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>&ldquo;usurped its place.&rdquo;&nbsp; We find this 
superannuated instrument in the &ldquo;antique&rdquo; 
dealers&rsquo; shops, at a good figure&mdash;a quaint old world 
thing, of a sort of old-fashioned cut and pattern.&nbsp; There 
only do people appear to trouble themselves about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chops and tomato sauce.&rdquo;&nbsp; This too is 
superannuated also.&nbsp; A more correct taste is now chops <i>au
naturel</i>, and relying on their own natural juices; but we have
cutlets, with tomatos.</p>
<p>Again, are little boys no longer clad in &ldquo;a tight suit 
of corduroy, spangled with brass buttons of very considerable 
size:&rdquo; indeed corduroy is seldom seen save on the figures 
of some <i>chic</i> ladies.&nbsp; And how fortunate to live in 
days when a smart valet could be secured for twelve pounds a 
year, and two suits; <a name="citation24"></a><a 
href="#footnote24" class="citation">[24]</a> and not less.</p>
<p>Surprising too was the valet&rsquo;s accustomed dress.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;A grey coat, a black hat, with a <!-- page 25--><a 
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>cockade on 
it, a pink striped waistcoat, light breeches and 
gaiters.&rdquo;&nbsp; What too were &ldquo;bright <i>basket</i> 
buttons&rdquo; on a brown coat?&nbsp; Fancy Balls too, like Mrs. 
Leo Hunter&rsquo;s, were given in the daytime, and caused no 
astonishment.&nbsp; Nor have we lodging-houses with beds on the 
&ldquo;twopenny rope&rdquo; principle.&nbsp; There are no 
&ldquo;dry arches&rdquo; of Waterloo Bridge: though here I 
suspect Boz was confounding them with those of the Adelphi.</p>
<p>Gone too are the simple games of childhood.&nbsp; Marbles for 
instance.&nbsp; We recall Serjeant Buzfuz&rsquo;s pathetic 
allusion to little Bardell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alley Tors and 
Commoneys; the long familiar cry of &lsquo;knuckle down&rsquo; is
neglected.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who sees a boy playing marbles now in the
street or elsewhere?&nbsp; Mr. Lang in his edition gives us no 
lore about this point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alley Tors&rdquo; was short 
for &ldquo;Alabaster,&rdquo; the material of which the 
<i>best</i> marbles were made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tor&rdquo; however, is usually spelt 
&ldquo;Taw.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Commoneys&rdquo; were the 
inferior or <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>commoner kind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knuckle 
down,&rdquo; according to our recollections, was the laying the 
knuckle on the ground for a shot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Odd and 
even&rdquo; was also spoken of by the Serjeant.&nbsp; Another 
game alluded to, is mysteriously called 
&ldquo;Tip-cheese&rdquo;&mdash;of which the latest editor 
speculates &ldquo;probably Tip-cat was meant: the game at which 
Bunyan was distinguishing himself when he had a 
call.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;cat&rdquo; was a plain piece of 
wood, sharpened at both ends.&nbsp; I suppose made to jump, like 
a cat.&nbsp; But <i>unde</i> &ldquo;cheese,&rdquo; unless it was 
a piece of rind that was struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flying the garter&rdquo; is another of the Pickwickian 
boy games.&nbsp; Talking with a very old gentleman, lately, I 
thought of asking him concerning &ldquo;Flying the garter:&rdquo;
he at once enlightened me.&nbsp; It was a familiar thing he 
remembered well &ldquo;when a boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a sort of 
&ldquo;Leap Frog,&rdquo; exercise&mdash;only with a greater and 
longer spring: he <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>spoke also of a shuffle of the feet 
during the process.</p>
<p>And again.&nbsp; There is a piquant quaintness in the 
upside-down turning of every thing in this wonderful Book.&nbsp; 
Such as Perker&rsquo;s eyes, which are described as playing with 
his &ldquo;inquisitive nose&rdquo; a &ldquo;perpetual game 
of&rdquo;&mdash;what, think you?&nbsp; Bo-Peep? not at all: but 
&ldquo;peep-bo.&rdquo;&nbsp; How odd and unaccountable!&nbsp; We 
all knew the little &ldquo;Bo-peep,&rdquo; and her 
sheep&mdash;but &ldquo;peep-bo&rdquo; is quite a reversal.</p>
<p>Gas was introduced into London about the year 1812 and was 
thought a prodigiously &ldquo;brilliant illuminant.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
But in the Pickwickian days it was still in a crude 
state&mdash;and we can see in the first print&mdash;that of the 
club room&mdash;only two attenuated jets over the table.&nbsp; In
many of the prints we find the dip or mould candle, which was 
used to light Sam as he sat in the coffee room of the Blue 
Boar.&nbsp; Mr. Nupkins&rsquo; kitchen was <i>not</i> lit by 
gas.</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>As to this matter of light&mdash;it all depends on habit
and accommodating.&nbsp; When a boy I have listened to 
&ldquo;Ivanhoe&rdquo; read out&mdash;O enchantment! by the light 
of <i>two</i> &ldquo;mould&rdquo; candles&mdash;the regular 
thing&mdash;which required &ldquo;snuffing&rdquo; about every ten
minutes, and snuffing required dexterity.&nbsp; The 
snuffers&mdash;laid on a long tray&mdash;were of ponderous 
construction; it was generally some one&rsquo;s regular duty to 
snuff&mdash;how odd seems this now!&nbsp; The &ldquo;plaited 
wicks&rdquo; which came later were thought a triumph, and the 
snuffers disappeared.&nbsp; They also are to be seen in the Curio
Shops.</p>
<p>How curious, too, the encroachment of a too practical age on 
the old romance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fainting&rdquo; was the regular 
thing in the Pickwickian days, in any agitation; &ldquo;burnt 
feathers&rdquo; and the &ldquo;sal volatile&rdquo; being the 
remedy.&nbsp; The beautiful, tender and engaging creatures we see
in the annuals, all fainted regularly&mdash;and knew <i>how</i> 
to faint&mdash;were perhaps taught it.&nbsp; Thus when Mr. 
Pickwick <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>was assumed to have 
&ldquo;proposed&rdquo; to his landlady, she in business-like 
fashion actually &ldquo;fainted;&rdquo; now-a-days 
&ldquo;fainting&rdquo; has gone out as much as duelling.</p>
<p>In the travellers&rsquo; rooms at Hotels&mdash;in the 
&ldquo;commercial&rdquo; room&mdash;we do not see people smoking 
&ldquo;large Dutch pipes&rdquo;&mdash;nor is &ldquo;brandy and 
water&rdquo; the only drink of the smoking room.&nbsp; Mr. 
Pickwick and his friends were always &ldquo;breaking the waxen 
seals&rdquo; of their letters&mdash;while Sam, and people of his 
degree, used the wafer.&nbsp; (What by the way was the &ldquo;fat
little boy&rdquo;&mdash;in the seal of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s 
penitential letter to his sire?&nbsp; Possibly a cupid.)&nbsp; 
Snuff taking was then common enough in the case of professional 
people like Perker.</p>
<p>At this moment there is to be seen in the corner of many an 
antique Hall&mdash;Sedan chair laid up in ordinary&mdash;of black
leather, bound with brass-nails.&nbsp; We can well recall in our 
boyish days, mamma in full dress and her hair in 
&ldquo;bands,&rdquo; going out to dine in her <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>chair.&nbsp; 
On arriving at the house the chair was taken up the steps and 
carried bodily into the Hall&mdash;the chair men drew out their 
poles, lifted the head, opened the door and the dame stepped 
out.&nbsp; The operation was not without its state.</p>
<p>Gone too are the &ldquo;carpet bags&rdquo; which Mr. Pickwick 
carried and also Mr. Slurk&mdash;(why he brought it with him into
the kitchen is not very clear). <a name="citation30"></a><a 
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>Skates were then spelt &ldquo;Skaits.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;Heavy smack,&rdquo; transported luggage&mdash;to the 
Provinces by river or canal.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Twopenny 
Postman&rdquo; is often alluded to.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Campstools,&rdquo; carried about for use, excited no 
astonishment.&nbsp; Gentlemen don&rsquo;t go to Reviews now, as 
Mr. Wardle did, arrayed in &ldquo;a blue coat and bright buttons,
corduroy (Boz also spells it <i>corderoy</i>) breeches and top 
boots,&rdquo; nor ladies &ldquo;in scarfs and 
feathers.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is curious, by the way, that Wardle 
talks <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>something after the fashionable 
manner of our day, dropping his g&rsquo;s&mdash;as who should say
&ldquo;huntin&rsquo;,&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;rippin&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I spent some 
evnins&rdquo; he says &ldquo;at your club.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My
gals,&rdquo; he says also.&nbsp; &ldquo;Capons&rdquo; are not 
much eaten now.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drinking wine&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;having a glass of wine&rdquo; has gone out, and with it 
Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s gallant manner of challenge to a fair one, 
<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;touching the enchanting Rachel&rsquo;s wrist 
with one hand and gently elevating his bottle with the 
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pope Joan&rdquo; is little played now,
if at all; &ldquo;Fish&rdquo; too; how rarely one sees those 
mother-of-pearl fish!&nbsp; The &ldquo;Cloth is not 
<i>drawn</i>&rdquo; and the table exposed to view, to be covered 
with dessert, bottles, glasses, etc.&nbsp; The shining mahogany 
was always a brave show, and we fear this comes of using cheap 
made up tables of common wood.&nbsp; Still we wot of some homes, 
old houses in the country, where the practice is kept up.&nbsp; 
It is evident that Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s dinner was at about 3 or 4 
o&rsquo;clock, for none was offered to the party <!-- page 
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>that 
arrived about 6.&nbsp; This we may presume was the mode in old 
fashioned country houses.&nbsp; Supper came at eleven.</p>
<p>A chaise and four could go at the pace of fifteen miles an 
hour.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;1000 horse-power&rdquo; was Jingle&rsquo;s idea of 
extravagant speed by steam agency.&nbsp; Now we have got to 4, 5,
and 10 thousand horsepower.&nbsp; Gentlemen&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;frills&rdquo; in the daytime are never seen now.&nbsp; 
Foot gear took the shape of &ldquo;Hessians&rsquo;&rdquo; 
&ldquo;halves,&rdquo; &ldquo;painted tops,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Wellington&rsquo;s&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bluchers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There are many other trifles which will evidence these 
changes.&nbsp; We are told of the &ldquo;common eighteen-penny 
French skull cap.&rdquo;&nbsp; Note <i>common</i>&mdash;it is 
exhibited on Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s head&mdash;a rather smartish 
thing with a tassel.&nbsp; Nightcaps, too, they are surely gone 
by now: though a few old people may wear them, but then boys and 
young men all did.&nbsp; It also had a tassel.&nbsp; There is the
&ldquo;Frog Hornpipe,&rdquo; whatever dance that was: the 
&ldquo;pousette;&rdquo; while &ldquo;cold srub,&rdquo; which <!--
page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
33</span>is not in much vogue now, was the drink of the Bath 
Footmen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Botany Bay ease, and New South Wales 
gentility,&rdquo; refer to the old convict days.&nbsp; This 
indeed is the most startling transformation of all.&nbsp; For 
instead of Botany Bay, and its miserable associations, we have 
the grand flourishing Australia, with its noble cities, 
Parliaments and the rest.&nbsp; Gone out too, we suppose, the 
&ldquo;Oxford-mixture trousers;&rdquo; &ldquo;Oxford grey&rdquo; 
it was then called.</p>
<p>Then for Sam&rsquo;s &ldquo;Profeel machine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. 
Andrew Lang in his notes wonders what this &ldquo;Profeel 
machine&rdquo; was, and fancies it was the silhouette 
process.&nbsp; This had nothing to do with the &ldquo;Profeel 
machine&rdquo;&mdash;which is described in &ldquo;Little 
Pedlington,&rdquo; a delightful specimen of Pickwickian humour, 
and which ought to be better known than it is.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
now,&rdquo; said Daubson, the painter of &ldquo;the all but 
breathing Grenadier,&rdquo; (alas! rejected by the 
Academy).&nbsp; &ldquo;Then get up and sit down, if <!-- page 
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>you 
please, mister.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He pointed to a narrow 
high-backed chair, placed on a platform; by the side of the chair
was a machine of curious construction, from which protruded a 
long wire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Heady stiddy, mister.&rsquo;&nbsp; He 
then slowly drew the wire over my head and down my nose and 
chin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the &ldquo;Profeel 
machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many antiquated allusions in Pickwick&mdash;which 
have often exercised the ingenuity of the curious.&nbsp; 
Sam&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fanteegs,&rdquo; has been given up in 
despair&mdash;as though there were no solution&mdash;yet, 
Professor Skeat, an eminent authority, has long since furnished 
it. <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34" 
class="citation">[34]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the button hole&rdquo;&mdash;a slang term for 
the mouth, has been well &ldquo;threshed out&rdquo;&mdash;as it 
is called.&nbsp; Of &ldquo;My Prooshian Blue,&rdquo; as his son 
affectedly styled his parent, Mr. Lang correctly suggests the 
solution, that the term came of George IV&rsquo;s intention of 
changing <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the uniform of the Army to 
Blue.&nbsp; But this has been said before.</p>
<p>Boz in his Pickwickian names was fond of disguising their 
sense to the eye, though not to the ear.&nbsp; Thus Lady 
Snuphanuph, looks a grotesque, but somewhat plausible 
name&mdash;snuff-enough&mdash;a further indication of the manners
and customs.&nbsp; So with Lord Mutanhed, <i>i.e.</i> 
&ldquo;Muttonhead.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mallard, Serjeant Snubbin&rsquo;s
Clerk, I have suspected, may have been some Mr. Duck&mdash;whom 
&ldquo;Boz&rdquo; had known&mdash;in that line.</p>
<h2><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
36</span>&ldquo;A MONUMENTAL PICKWICK.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The fruitfulness of Pickwick, and amazing prolificness, that 
is one of its marvels.&nbsp; It is regularly &ldquo;worked 
on,&rdquo; like Dante or Shakespeare.&nbsp; The Pickwickian 
Library is really a wonder.&nbsp; It is intelligible how a work 
like Boswell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Johnson,&rdquo; full of allusions and
names of persons who have lived, spoken, and written, should give
rise to explanation and commentaries; but a work of mere 
imagination, it would be thought, could not furnish such 
openings.&nbsp; As we have just seen, Pickwick and the other 
characters are so real, so artfully blended with existing usages,
manners, and localities, as to become actual living things.</p>
<p>Mere panegyric of one&rsquo;s favourite is idle.&nbsp; So I 
lately took a really effective way of <i>proving</i> the 
surprising fertility of the work and of its power of engendering 
speculation and illustration.&nbsp; <!-- page 37--><a 
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>I set about 
collecting all that has been done, written, and drawn on the 
subject during these sixty years past, together with all those 
lighter manifestations of popularity which surely indicate 
&ldquo;the form and pressure&rdquo; of its influence.&nbsp; The 
result is now before me, and all but fills a small room.&nbsp; 
When set in proper order and bound, it will fill over thirty 
great quartos&mdash;&ldquo;huge armfuls&rdquo; as Elia has 
it.&nbsp; In short, it is a &ldquo;Monumental 
Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The basis of <i>The Text</i> is of course, the original 
edition of 1836.&nbsp; There are specimens of the titles and a 
few pages of every known edition; the first cheap or popular one;
the &ldquo;Library&rdquo; edition; the &ldquo;Charles 
Dickens&rdquo; ditto; the <i>Edition de Luxe</i>; the 
&ldquo;Victoria&rdquo;: &ldquo;Jubilee,&rdquo; edited by C. 
Dickens the younger; editions at a shilling and at sixpence; the 
edition sold for one penny; the new &ldquo;Gadshill,&rdquo; 
edited by Andrew Lang; with the &ldquo;Roxburghe,&rdquo; edited 
by F. Kitton, presently to be published.&nbsp; The <i>Foreign 
Editions in </i><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span><i>English</i>; four American 
editions, two of Philadelphia, and two of New York; the Tauchnitz
(German) and Baudry (French); the curious Calcutta edition; with 
one of the most interesting editions, viz., the one published at 
Launceston in Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land in the year 1839, that is 
before the name of the Colony was changed.&nbsp; The publisher 
speaks feelingly of the enormous difficulties he had to 
encounter, and he boasts, with a certain pride, that it is 
&ldquo;the largest publication that has issued from either the 
New South Wales or the Tasmanian Press.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only 
this, but the whole of the work, printing, engraving, and 
binding, was executed in the Colony.&nbsp; He had to be content 
with lithography for the plates, and indeed, could only manage a 
selection of twenty of the best.&nbsp; He says, too, that even in
England, lithography is found a process of considerable 
difficulty.&nbsp; They are executed in a very rough and imperfect
way, and not very faithfully by an artist who signs himself 
&ldquo;Tiz.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor, <!-- page 39--><a 
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>but spirited 
publisher adds that the expense has been 
enormous&mdash;&ldquo;greater than was originally 
contemplated,&rdquo; but he comforts himself with the compliment 
that &ldquo;if any publication would repay the cost of its 
production, it would be the far-famed Pickwick 
Papers.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the whole, it is a very interesting 
edition to have, and I have never seen a copy save the one I 
possess.&nbsp; I have also an American edition, printed in 
Philadelphia, which has a great interest.&nbsp; It was bought 
there by Mrs. Charles Dickens, and presented by her to her 
faithful maid, Anne.&nbsp; I possess also a copy of the Christmas
Carol given by his son, the author, to his father John.&nbsp; Few
recall that &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; wrote a sequel to his 
Pickwick&mdash;a rather dismal failure&mdash;quite devoid of 
humour.&nbsp; He revived Sam and old Weller, and Mr. Pickwick, 
but they are unrecognizable figures.&nbsp; He judiciously 
suppressed this attempt, after making it a sort of introduction 
to Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock.&nbsp; Of course, we have it here.</p>

44</span>The most curious tribute is the issue by the 
Phonographic Society of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; in shorthand; and,
finally, &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; in raised characters on the 
Braille system for the blind.</p>
<p>This odd publication of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; for the Blind 
came about in a quaint way enough.&nbsp; As we know, the author 
issued at his own expense one of his works in raised characters, 
as a present to these afflicted persons.&nbsp; A rich old 
gentleman had noticed a blind beggar seated with the Bible open 
on his knees, droning out the passages in the usual 
fashion.&nbsp; Some of the impostor sort learn the lines by heart
and &ldquo;make believe&rdquo; to read, as they pass their 
fingers over the characters.&nbsp; The rich old gentleman&rsquo;s
blind reader read in the genuine way, and got through about fifty
chapters a day.&nbsp; No one, however, is much improved by the 
lecture.&nbsp; They merely wonder at the phenomenon and go their 
way.&nbsp; The rich old gentleman presently spoke to the blind 
reader: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you read &lsquo;Pickwick&rsquo; 
<!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>or some other book that the public will listen 
to?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he replied&mdash;he must have
been of the stock of Silas Wegg&mdash;&ldquo;give me 
&lsquo;Pickwick&rsquo; in raised characters and I will read 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rich old gentleman went his way and inquired at the proper
places, but the work was not known.&nbsp; He gave an order for a 
hundred copies of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; in &ldquo;Wait&rsquo;s 
Improved Braille Type,&rdquo; and in about six months it was 
delivered to him&mdash;not the whole work, but a selection of the
more effective episodes.&nbsp; The blind reader was pleased; the 
old gentleman insisted on a private rehearsal; select passages 
were chosen which were calculated to take about twenty minutes 
each.&nbsp; When he arrived on the morning fixed for the first 
attempt, he found his friend at his post with quite a crowd 
gathered round him, in convulsions of laughter.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;poor blind&rdquo; was reading, or feeling out, old Mr. 
Weller&rsquo;s ejectment of the red-nosed man.&nbsp; The hat was 
overflowing with coppers and <!-- page 46--><a 
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>even 
silver.&nbsp; So things went on prospering for a while.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; was a magnificent success, and the blind 
man was never without a crowd round him of some fifteen to fifty 
persons.&nbsp; But the other blind readers found the demand for 
the sacred text vanishing; and people would unfeelingly interrupt
them to inquire the way to the &ldquo;Pickwick man.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Eventually the police began to interfere, and required him to 
&ldquo;move on;&rdquo; &ldquo;he was obstructing the 
pavement&rdquo;&mdash;not, perhaps, he, but 
&ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; He <i>did</i> move on to Hyde Park,
but there were others there, performers young and up-to-date, and
with full use of their eyes, who did the same thing with action 
and elocution.&nbsp; So he fairly gave the thing up, and returned
to his Scriptures.&nbsp; This tale would have amused 
&ldquo;Boz&rdquo; himself.</p>
<p>Of a more miscellaneous kind are &ldquo;The Pickwick 
Songster,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sam Weller&rsquo;s Almanac,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Sam Weller&rsquo;s Song Book,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pickwick 
Pen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, what a boon and a blessing to men,&rdquo; 
etc.,&mdash;to say nothing of <!-- page 47--><a 
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>innumerable 
careless sheets, and trifles of all kinds and of every 
degree.&nbsp; Then we have adapted advertisements.&nbsp; The 
Proprietors of Beecham&rsquo;s Pills use the scene of Mr. 
Pickwick&rsquo;s discovery of the Bill Stumps inscription.&nbsp; 
Some carpet cleaners have Sam and the pretty housemaid folding 
the carpet.&nbsp; Lastly comes the author, &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; 
himself, with letters, portraits, pictures of his homes, etc., 
all more or less connected with the period when he was writing 
this book, a facsimile of his receipt for copy money, a copy of 
his agreement with Chapman and Hall, and many more items. <a 
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47" 
class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<p>I have often wondered how it was that &ldquo;the inimitable 
Boz,&rdquo; took so little interest in his great Book.&nbsp; It 
always seemed to me <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>that he did not care for praise of 
it, or wish much that it should be alluded to.&nbsp; But he at 
once became interested, when you spoke of some of his artful 
plots, in Bleak House, or Little Dorrit&mdash;then his eye 
kindled.&nbsp; He may have fancied, as his friend Forster also 
did, that Pickwick was a rather <i>jejune</i> juvenile thing, 
inartistically planned, and thrown off, or rather rattled 
off.&nbsp; His <i>penchant</i>, as was the case with Liston and 
some of the low comedians, was for harrowing tragedy and 
pathos.</p>
<p>Once when driving with him on a jaunting car in Dublin, he 
asked me, did I know so-and-so, and I answered promptly in Mr. 
Winkle&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him, but I have 
seen him.&rdquo;&nbsp; This <i>apropos</i> made him laugh 
heartily.&nbsp; I am now inclined to think that the real 
explanation of his distaste was, that the Book was associated 
with one of the most painful and distracting episodes of his 
life, which affected him so acutely, that he actually flung aside
his work in the full <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>tumult of success, and left the eager
public without its regular monthly number.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have 
been so unnerved&rdquo; he writes, in an unpublished letter to 
Harrison Ainsworth, &ldquo;and hurt by the loss of the dear girl 
whom I loved, after my wife, more dearly and fervently than 
anyone on earth, that I have been compelled for once to give up 
all idea of my monthly work, and to try a fortnight&rsquo;s rest 
and quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this long book, there are found allusions to only two or 
three other works.&nbsp; What these are might form one of the 
questions &ldquo;set&rdquo; at the next Pickwick 
examination.&nbsp; Fielding is quoted once.&nbsp; In the 
dedication allusion is made to Talfourd&rsquo;s three speeches in
Parliament, on the copyright question; these were published in a 
little volume, and make, fairly enough, one of the illustrative 
documents of &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the first number of
the first edition there is an odd note, rather out of place, but 
it was withdrawn later&mdash;meant to ridicule Mr. <!-- page 
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
50</span>Jingle&rsquo;s story of &ldquo;Ponto&rsquo;s&rdquo; 
sagacity; it states that in Mr. Jesse&rsquo;s gleanings, there 
are more amazing stories than this.</p>
<p>Mr. Jesse was a sort of personage living at 
Richmond&mdash;where I well remember him, when I was there as a 
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jesse&rsquo;s gleanings&rdquo; was then a 
well-known and popular book; and his stories of dogs are 
certainly extraordinary enough to have invoked Boz&rsquo;s 
ridicule.&nbsp; We are told of the French poodle, who after 
rolling himself in the mud of the Seine, would rub himself 
against any well-polished boots that he noticed, and would thus 
bring custom to his master, who was a shoe black on the <i>Pont 
Neuf</i>.&nbsp; He was taken to London by an English purchaser, 
but in a few days disappeared, and was discovered pursuing his 
old trade on the Bridge.&nbsp; Other dogs, we were told, after 
being transported long distances, would invariably find their way
back.&nbsp; These prodigies, however, do not appear so wonderful 
now, after the strange things about dogs and cats that <!-- page 
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>have 
been retailed in a well-known &ldquo;weekly.&rdquo;&nbsp; A third
allusion is to Sterne&rsquo;s <i>Maria of Moulines</i>, made, of 
all people in the world, by Sam Weller.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;BOZ&rdquo; AND &ldquo;BOZZY.&rdquo;</h2>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
52</span>It may seem somewhat far-fetched to put 
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; beside Boswell&rsquo;s also immortal work,
but I think really the comparison is not a fanciful one.&nbsp; No
one enjoyed the book so much as &ldquo;Boz.&rdquo;&nbsp; He knew 
it thoroughly.&nbsp; Indeed, it is fitting that &ldquo;Boz&rdquo;
should relish &ldquo;Bozzy;&rdquo; for &ldquo;Bozzy&rdquo; would 
certainly have relished &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; and have 
&ldquo;attended him with respectful attention.&rdquo;&nbsp; It 
has not been yet shown how much there is in common between the 
two great books, and, indeed, between them and a third, greater 
than either, the immortal &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo;&nbsp; All 
three are &ldquo;travelling stories.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sterne also was
partial to a travelling story.&nbsp; Lately, when a guest at the 
&ldquo;Johnson Club,&rdquo; I ventured to expound minutely, and 
at length, this curious similarity between Boswell and 
Dickens.&nbsp; Dickens&rsquo; appreciation of &ldquo;Bozzy&rdquo;
<!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
53</span>is proved by his admirable parody which is found in one 
of his letters to Wilkie Collins, and which is superior to 
anything of the sort&mdash;to Chalmers&rsquo;, Walcot&rsquo;s, or
any that have been attempted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; as Dr. Johnson would have said,
&ldquo;if it be not irrational in a man to count his feathered 
bipeds before they are hatched, we will conjointly astonish them 
next year.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Boswell</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir, I 
hardly understand you.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Johnson</i>.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You never understood anything.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Boswell</i>
(in a sprightly manner).&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps, sir, I am all the 
better for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Johnson</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not
know but that you are.&nbsp; There is Lord Carlisle 
(smiling)&mdash;he never understands anything, and yet the dog is
well enough.&nbsp; Then, sir, there is Forster&mdash;he 
understands many things, and yet the fellow is fretful.&nbsp; 
Again, sir, there is Dickens, with a facile way with 
him&mdash;like Davy, sir, like Davy&mdash;yet I am told that the 
man is lying at a hedge alehouse by the seashore in Kent as long 
as they will trust him.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Boswell</i>.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But there are no hedges by the sea in Kent, 
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Johnson</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;And why not, 
sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Boswell</i> (at a loss).&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
don&rsquo;t <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>know, sir, unless&mdash;&rdquo; 
<i>Johnson</i> (thundering).&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us have no 
unlesses, sir.&nbsp; If your father had never said unless he 
would never have begotten you, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Boswell</i> 
(yielding).&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir, that is very true.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To begin, the Christian names of the two great men were the 
same.&nbsp; Sam Johnson and Samuel Pickwick.&nbsp; Johnson had a 
relation called Nathaniel, and Pickwick had a 
&ldquo;follower&rdquo; also Nathaniel.&nbsp; Both the great men 
founded Clubs: Johnson&rsquo;s was in Essex Street, Strand, to 
say nothing of the Literary or Johnson Club; the other in Huggin 
Lane.&nbsp; Johnson had his Goldsmith, Reynolds, Boswell, Burke, 
and the rest, as his members and &ldquo;followers:&rdquo; Mr. 
Pickwick had his Tupman, Snodgrass, Winkle, and others.&nbsp; 
These were the &ldquo;travelling members,&rdquo; just as Dr. 
Johnson and Boswell were the travelling members of their 
Club.&nbsp; Boswell was the notetaker, so was Snodgrass.&nbsp; 
When we see the pair staying at the Three Crowns at 
Lichfield&mdash;calling on friends&mdash;waited on by <!-- page 
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>the 
manager of the local Theatre, etc., we are forcibly reminded of 
the visits to Rochester and Ipswich.</p>
<p>Boswell one night dropped into a tavern in Butcher Row, and 
saw his great friend in a warm discussion with a strange 
Irishman, who was very short with him, and the sketch recalls 
very forcibly Mr. Pickwick at the Magpie and Stump, where old 
Jack Bamber told him that he knew nothing about the mysteries of 
the old haunted chambers in Clifford&rsquo;s Inn and such 
places.&nbsp; The Turk&rsquo;s Head, the Crown and Anchor, the 
Cheshire Cheese, The Mitre, may be set beside the Magpie and 
Stump, the George and Vulture, and White Horse Cellars.</p>
<p>More curious still in Boswell&rsquo;s life, there is mentioned
a friend of Johnson&rsquo;s who is actually 
named&mdash;Weller!&nbsp; I leave it as a pleasant crux for the 
ingenious Pickwickian to find out where.</p>
<p>Johnson had his faithful servant, Frank: Mr. Pickwick his 
Sam.&nbsp; The two sages <!-- page 56--><a 
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>equally 
revelled in travelling in post-chaises and staying at inns; both 
made friends with people in the coaches and commercial 
rooms.&nbsp; There are also some odd accidental coincidences 
which help in the likeness.&nbsp; Johnson was constantly in the 
Borough, and we have a good scene with Mr. Pickwick at the White 
Hart in the same place.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick had his widow, Mrs. 
Bardell; and Johnson his in the person of the fair Thrale.&nbsp; 
Johnson had his friend Taylor at Ashbourne, to whom he often went
on visits, always going down by coach; while Mr. Pickwick had his
friend Wardle, with whom he stayed at Manor Farm, in Kent.&nbsp; 
We know of the review at Rochester which Mr. Pickwick and friends
attended, and how they were charged by the soldiery.&nbsp; Oddly 
enough Dr. Johnson attended a review also at Rochester, when he 
was on a visit to his friend Captain Langton.&nbsp; Johnson, 
again, found his way to Bath, went to the Assembly Rooms, etc.; 
and our friend Mr. Pickwick, we need not say, <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>also enjoyed 
himself there.&nbsp; In Boswell&rsquo;s record we have a 
character called Mudge, an &ldquo;out of the way&rdquo; name; and
in Pickwick we find a Mudge.&nbsp; George Steevens, who figures 
so much in Boswell&rsquo;s work, was the author of an antiquarian
hoax played off on a learned brother, of the same class as 
&ldquo;Bill Stumps, his mark.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had an old 
inscription engraved on an unused bit of pewter&mdash;it was well
begrimed and well battered, then exposed for sale in a 
broker&rsquo;s shop, where it was greedily purchased by the 
credulous virtuoso.&nbsp; The notion, by the way, of the Club 
button was taken from the Prince Regent, who had his Club and 
uniform, which he allowed favourites to wear.</p>
<p>There is a story in Boswell&rsquo;s Biography which is 
transferred to &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; that of the unlucky 
gentleman who died from a surfeit of crumpets; Sam, it will be 
recollected, describes it as a case of the man &ldquo;as killed 
hisself on principle.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He used to go away to a coffee-house after 
<!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
58</span>his dinner and have a small pot o&rsquo; coffee and four
crumpets.&nbsp; He fell ill and sent for the doctor.&nbsp; Doctor
comes in a green fly vith a kind o&rsquo; Robinson Crusoe set 
o&rsquo; steps as he could let down ven he got out, and pull up 
arter him ven he got in, to perwent the necessity o&rsquo; the 
coachman&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; down, and thereby 
undeceivin&rsquo; the public by lettin&rsquo; &rsquo;em see that 
it wos only a livery coat he&rsquo;d got on, and not the trousers
to match.&nbsp; &lsquo;How many crumpets at a sittin&rsquo; do 
you think &rsquo;ud kill me off at once?&rsquo; said the 
patient.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; says the 
doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you think half a crown&rsquo;s vurth 
&rsquo;ud do it?&rsquo; says the patient.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think it
might,&rsquo; says the doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Three shillin&rsquo; 
&rsquo;s vurth &rsquo;ud be sure to do it, I s&rsquo;pose?&rsquo;
says the patient.&nbsp; &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; says the 
doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wery good,&rsquo; says the patient; 
&lsquo;good-night.&rsquo;&nbsp; Next mornin&rsquo; he gets up, 
has a fire lit, orders in three shillin&rsquo;s&rsquo; vurth 
o&rsquo; crumpets, toasts &rsquo;em all, eat &rsquo;em all, and 
blows his brains out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he do that for?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick 
abruptly; for he was considerably startled by this tragical 
termination of the narrative.</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>&ldquo;Wot did he do it for, sir?&rdquo; reiterated 
Sam.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wy, in support of his great principle that 
crumpets was wholesome, and to show that he vouldn&rsquo;t be put
out of his vay for nobody!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus Dickens marvellously enriched this quaint story.&nbsp; It
may be found amusing to trace the genesis of the tale.&nbsp; In 
Boswell it runs: &ldquo;Mr. Fitzherbert, who loved buttered 
muffins, but durst not eat them because they disagreed with his 
stomach, resolved to shoot himself, and then eat three buttered 
muffins for breakfast, knowing that he should not be troubled 
with indigestion.&rdquo;&nbsp; We find that De Quincey, in one of
his essays, reports the case of an officer holding the rank of 
lieutenant-colonel who could not tolerate a breakfast without 
muffins.&nbsp; But he suffered agonies of indigestion.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;He would stand the nuisance no longer, but yet, being a 
just man, he would give Nature one final chance of reforming her 
dyspeptic atrocities.&nbsp; Muffins therefore being laid at one 
angle of the table and pistols at the other, with rigid equity 
the <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>Colonel awaited the result.&nbsp; This was naturally 
pretty much as usual; and then the poor man, incapable of 
retreating from his word of honour, committed suicide, having 
left a line for posterity to the effect, &ldquo;that a muffinless
world was no world for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be recollected that, during the Christmas festivities 
at Manor Farm, after a certain amount of kissing had taken place 
under the mistletoe, Mr. Pickwick was &ldquo;standing under the 
mistletoe, looking with a very pleased countenance on all that 
was passing round him, when the young lady with the black eyes, 
after a little whispering with the other young ladies, made a 
sudden dart forward, and putting her arm round Mr. 
Pickwick&rsquo;s neck, saluted him affectionately on the left 
cheek, and before he distinctly knew what was the matter he was 
surrounded by the whole bevy, and kissed by every one of 
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Compare with this <!-- page 61--><a 
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>what happened
to Dr. Johnson in the Hebrides:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This evening one of our married ladies, a 
lively, pretty little woman, good-humouredly sat down upon Dr. 
Johnson&rsquo;s knee, and being encouraged by some of the 
company, put her hands round his neck and kissed him.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Do it again,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and let us see who 
will tire first.&rdquo;&nbsp; He kept her on his knee some time 
while he and she drank tea.&nbsp; He was now like a <i>buck</i> 
indeed.&nbsp; All the company were much entertained to find him 
so easy and pleasant.&nbsp; To me it was highly comic to see the 
grave philosopher&mdash;the Rambler&mdash;toying with a Highland 
beauty!&nbsp; But what could he do?&nbsp; He must have been 
surly, and weak too, had he not behaved as he did.&nbsp; He would
have been laughed at, and not more respected, though less 
loved.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was not this Mr. Pickwick exactly?</p>
<p>Or, we might fancy this little scene taking place at Dunvegan 
Castle, on the night of the dance, when Johnson was in such high 
good-humour.&nbsp; His faithful henchman might <!-- page 62--><a 
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>have come up 
to him and have said jocosely, &ldquo;<i>You</i>, sir, in silk 
stockings?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And why not, sir&mdash;why not?&rdquo; said
the Doctor warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; I answered,
&ldquo;there is no reason why you should not wear 
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I imagine not, sir&mdash;I imagine 
not,&rdquo; said the Doctor in a very peremptory tone.&nbsp; I 
had contemplated a laugh, but found it was a serious 
matter.&nbsp; I looked grave, and said they were a pretty 
pattern.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope they are,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, 
fixing his eyes upon me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see nothing 
extraordinary in these stockings <i>as</i> stockings, I trust, 
sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly not; oh, certainly not,&rdquo;
I replied, and my revered friend&rsquo;s countenance assumed its 
customary benign expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, is not this Pickwickian all over?&nbsp; Yet it is the 
exact record of what occurred at Manor Farm, in 
&ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; with a change only in the names, and 
would pass very fairly as an amiable outburst of the redoubtable 
Doctor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Or, again, let us put a bit of &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; into <!-- 
page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>&ldquo;Bozzy&rsquo;s&rdquo; work.&nbsp; The amiable 
&ldquo;Goldy&rdquo; was partial to extravagant dress, and to 
showing himself off.</p>
<blockquote><p>When a masquerade at Ranelagh was talked of, he 
said to Doctor Johnson, &ldquo;I shall go as a 
Corsican.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the Doctor, with 
a sudden start.&nbsp; &ldquo;As a Corsican,&rdquo; Dr. Goldsmith 
repeated mildly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo;
said the Doctor to him, gazing at him with solemn sternness, 
&ldquo;that it is your intention to put yourself into a green 
velvet jacket with a two-inch tail?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Such 
<i>is</i> my intention, sir,&rdquo; replied Goldsmith warmly; 
&ldquo;and why not, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because, sir,&rdquo;
said the Doctor, considerably excited, &ldquo;you are too 
old.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Too old!&rdquo; exclaimed 
Goldsmith.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if any further ground of objection be
wanting,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;You are too fat, 
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Dr. Goldsmith, his face
suffused with a crimson glow, &ldquo;this is an 
insult.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the sage in the same
tone, &ldquo;it is not half the insult to you, that your 
appearance in my presence in a green velvet jacket with two-inch 
tail would be to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Dr. 
Goldsmith, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re <!-- page 64--><a 
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>a 
fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, 
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re another!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Winkle in a very amusing way often suggests Boswell; and Mr. 
Pickwick treats him with as great rudeness as did Johnson 
<i>his</i> Winkle.&nbsp; When that unhappy gentleman, or follower
exhibited himself on the ice, Mr. Pickwick, we are told, was 
excited and indignant.&nbsp; &ldquo;He beckoned to Mr. Weller and
said in a stern voice: Take the skates off.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No, but I had scarcely began,&rdquo; remonstrated Mr. 
Winkle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take his skates off,&rdquo; repeated Mr. 
Pickwick, firmly.&nbsp; The command was not to be resisted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lift him up,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick&mdash;Sam assisted 
him to rise.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from 
the by-standers and beckoning his friend to approach, fixed a 
searching look on him and uttered in a low, but distinct and 
emphatic tone, these remarkable words: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a 
humbug, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A what?&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, 
starting.&nbsp; &ldquo;A humbug, sir, I will speak plainer if you
wish it&mdash;an impostor, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 65--><a 
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>With these 
words Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his heel and rejoined his 
friends.&nbsp; Was not this exactly the Sage&rsquo;s treatment of
his &ldquo;Bozzy&rdquo; on many occasions?</p>
<p>There is yet another odd coincidence.&nbsp; Everyone knows how
Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s party was disturbed by Mrs. Raddle&rsquo;s 
angry expostulations, and the guests had to disperse.&nbsp; Well,
Mr. Boswell, who had much of the Sawyer tone&mdash;gave a party 
at his rooms in Downing Street, and his landlord behaved so 
outrageously, that he gave him notice, and the next day quitted 
his rooms.&nbsp; &ldquo;I feel I shall have to give my landlady 
notice,&rdquo; said Mr. Sawyer with a ghastly smile.&nbsp; Mr. 
Boswell had actually to take some of the invited guests to the 
Mitre and entertain them there.</p>
<p>There is a pleasant passage connected with Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
visit to Plymouth, with his old friend Sir Joshua.&nbsp; He was 
much pleased with this jaunt and declared he had derived from it 
a great accession of new ideas. . . <!-- page 66--><a 
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>&ldquo;The 
magnificence of the Navy the ship building and all its 
circumstances afforded him a grand subject of 
contemplation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He contemplated it in fact, as Mr. 
Pickwick contemplated Chatham and the Medway.&nbsp; The 
commissioner of the dockyard paid him the compliment, etc.&nbsp; 
The characteristic part, however, was that the Doctor entered 
enthusiastically into the local politics.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was 
a new town rising up round the dockyard, as a rival to the old 
one, and knowing from the sagacity and just observation of human 
nature, that it is certain if a man hates at all, he will hate 
his next neighbour, he concluded that this new and rising town 
could but excite the envy and jealousy of the old.&nbsp; He 
therefore set himself resolutely on the side of the old town, the
<i>established</i> town in which he was.&nbsp; Considering it a 
kind of duty to <i>stand</i> by it.&nbsp; He accordingly entered 
warmly into its interests, and upon every occasion talked of 
<i>the Dockers</i> as &ldquo;upstarts and aliens.&rdquo;&nbsp; As
they wanted to be supplied with water from <!-- page 67--><a 
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>the old town,
not having a drop themselves, Johnson affecting to entertain the 
passions of the place, was violent in opposition; and half 
laughing at himself for his pretended zeal, and where he had no 
concern, exclaimed: &ldquo;No!&nbsp; I am against the 
<i>Dockers</i>; I am a Plymouth man.&nbsp; Rogues! let them die 
of thirst; they shall not have a drop.&nbsp; I <i>hate</i> a 
Docker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now all this is very like what the amiable Pickwick would have
done; in fact like something he <i>did</i> do and felt, when he 
repaired to Eatanswill for the election.&nbsp; On entering the 
town he at once chose his party, and took it up 
enthusiastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;With his usual foresight and 
sagacity,&rdquo; like Dr. Johnson, he had chosen a fortunately 
desirable moment for his visit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Slumkey for 
ever,&rdquo; roared the honest and independent.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Slumkey for ever!&rdquo; echoed Mr. Pickwick, taking off 
his hat.&nbsp; &ldquo;No Fizkin,&rdquo; roared the crowd.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; shouted Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Who is <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Slumkey?&rdquo; whispered Mr. 
Tupman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. 
Pickwick, in the same tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hush! don&rsquo;t ask 
any questions.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s always best on these occasions to
do what the mob do.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But suppose there are two
mobs,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Snodgrass.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shout with the
largest,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; Volumes could not 
have said more.&nbsp; On asking for rooms at the Town Arms, which
was the Great White Horse, Mr. Pickwick was asked &ldquo;was he 
Blue.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick in reply, asked for Perker.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is blue I think.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O yes, 
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then <i>we</i> are blue,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, but observing the man looked rather doubtful at this 
accommodating account he gave him his card.&nbsp; Perker arranged
everything.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spirited contest, my dear sir,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I am delighted to hear it,&rdquo; said Mr. 
Pickwick.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like to see sturdy patriotism, on 
whatever side it is called forth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later, we are 
told, Mr. Pickwick entered heart and soul into the business, and,
like the sage, caught the <!-- page 69--><a 
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>prevailing 
excitement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Although <i>no great partisan of either 
side</i>, Mr. Pickwick was sufficiently fired by Mr. Pott&rsquo;s
enthusiasm to apply his whole time and attention to the 
proceedings, etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this, of course, does not 
correspond exactly, but the spirit of the selections are the 
same.</p>
<p>The Doctor it is known, would go out at midnight with his 
friends Beauclerk and Layton to have what he called &ldquo;a 
rouze,&rdquo; and Garrick was humorously apprehensive that he 
would have to bail out his old friend from the watchhouse.&nbsp; 
Mr. Pickwick had many a &ldquo;rouze&rdquo; with his 
followers.&nbsp; And Johnson himself, in the matter of drink, was
at one time as bad as Mr. Pickwick, only he had a better head, 
and could &ldquo;carry his liquor discreetly,&rdquo; like the 
Baron of Bradwardine.&nbsp; He had actually to give up drink on 
account of this tendency to excess.</p>
<h2><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>PICKWICKIAN ORIGINALS.</h2>
<p>There is a shrewd remark of the late Bishop Norwich, Dean 
Stanley&rsquo;s father, that to catch and describe the tone and 
feeling of a place gives a better idea of it than any minute or 
accurate description.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some books,&rdquo; he says, 
&ldquo;give one ideas of places without descriptions; there is 
something which suggests more vivid and agreeable images than 
distinct words.&nbsp; Would <i>Gil Blas</i> for instance?&nbsp; 
It opens with a scene of history, chivalry, Spain, orange trees, 
fountains, guitars, muleteers; there is the picturesque and the 
sense of the picturesque, as distinct as the actual 
object.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this exactly applies to 
&ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; which brings up before us Rochester, 
Ipswich, Muggleton, Birmingham, and a dozen other places to the 
tourist.&nbsp; The night of the arrival at Birmingham for 
instance, and the going out after dinner to call on Mr. Winkle, 
sen., is strangely vivid.</p>

<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
71</span>So real is our Pickwickian Odyssey that it can be 
followed in all its stages as in a diary.&nbsp; To put it all in 
&ldquo;ship shape&rdquo; as it were and enhance this practical 
feeling I have drawn out the route in a little map.&nbsp; It is 
wonderful how much the party saw and how much ground they 
covered, and it is not a far-fetched idea that were a similar 
party in our day, good humoured, venturesome and accessible, to 
visit old-fashioned, out of the way towns, and look out for fun, 
acquaintances and characters, they might have a good deal of the 
amusement and adventure that the Pickwickians enjoyed.</p>
<p>The Pickwickians first went to Rochester, Chatham, Dingley 
Dell, and perhaps to Gravesend.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick with Wardle 
then pursued Jingle to town, returning thence to the Dell, which 
he at once left for Cobham, where he found his friend 
Tupman.&nbsp; The party then returned to town.&nbsp; Next we have
the <i>first</i> visit to Ipswich&mdash;called 
Eatanswill&mdash;from which town Mr. Pickwick and Sam <!-- page 
72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
72</span>posted to Bury St. Edmunds; thence to London.&nbsp; Next
came their third expedition to Dingley Dell for the Christmas 
festivities.&nbsp; Then the second visit to Ipswich.&nbsp; Then 
the journey to Bath, and that from Bath to Bristol.&nbsp; Later a
second journey to Bristol&mdash;another from Bristol to 
Birmingham, and from Birmingham to London, Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s 
final junketing before retiring to Dulwich.</p>
<p>Yet another interesting side of the Pickwick story is its 
almost biographical character.&nbsp; Boz seems to take us with 
him from his very boyhood.&nbsp; During the old days when his 
father was at Chatham he had seen all the Rochester incidents, 
sat by the old Castle and Bridge, noted with admiring awe the 
dockyard people, the Balls at &ldquo;The Bull,&rdquo; the Reviews
on the Lines.&nbsp; The officers&mdash;like Dr. Slammer, all the 
figures&mdash;fat boy included&mdash;were drawn from this stage 
of his life.&nbsp; The Golden Cross, which figures also in 
<i>Copperfield</i>, he had constantly stopped at.&nbsp; He knew, 
too, the inns in the Boro&rsquo;.&nbsp; The large legal element 
<!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>and its odd incidents and characters he had learned and 
studied during his brief apprenticeship to the Law.&nbsp; The 
interior economy of the Fleet Prison he had learned from his 
family&rsquo;s disastrous experiences; the turnkeys, and blighted
inhabitants he had certainly taken from life.&nbsp; But he 
shifted the scene from the Marshalsea to the King&rsquo;s Bench 
Prison&mdash;the former place would have been too painful a 
reminiscence for his father.&nbsp; To his reporting expeditions 
we owe the Election scenes at Ipswich, and to another visit for 
the same object, his Bath experiences.&nbsp; Much of the 
vividness and reality of his touchings, particularly in the case 
of Rochester and its doings, is the magnifying, searching power 
resulting from a life of sorrow in childhood, family troubles 
working on a keen, sensitive nature; these made him appreciate 
and meditate on all that was going on about him, as a sort of 
relief and relaxation.&nbsp; All the London scenes the meetings 
at taverns&mdash;were personal experiences.&nbsp; Among his 
friends were medical <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>students and many odd beings.&nbsp; 
We can trace his extraordinary appreciation of 
Christmas&mdash;and its genial, softening festivities&mdash;which
clung to him till it altogether faded out, to the same sense of 
relief; it furnished an opportunity of forgetting for a time (at 
least), the dismal, gloomy home.</p>
<p>Boz, if he drew his characters from life, did not draw 
wholesale; he would take only a portion of a character that 
pleased him and work it up in combination with another distinct 
character.&nbsp; It was thus he dealt with Leigh Hunt, borrowing 
his amusing, airy frivolity, and combining it with the meanness 
and heartlessness of Skimpole.&nbsp; I have always fancied that 
Dowler in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; was founded&mdash;after this 
composite principle&mdash;on his true-hearted but imperious 
friend, Forster.&nbsp; Forster was indeed also a perfect 
reproduction of Dr. Johnson and had the despotic 
intolerance&mdash;in conversation certainly&mdash;of that great 
man.&nbsp; Like him &ldquo;if his pistol missed fire, he knocked 
you down with the <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>butt end of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could
be as amiable and tender-hearted as &ldquo;old Sam&rdquo; 
himself.&nbsp; Listening to Dowler at the coach office in 
Piccadilly we&mdash;who knew Forster well&mdash;seemed to hear 
his very voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a stern-eyed man of about 
five-and-forty, who had large black whiskers.&nbsp; He was 
buttoned up to the chin in a brown coat and had a large seal-skin
cap and a cloak beside him.&nbsp; He looked up from his breakfast
as Mr. Pickwick entered with a fierce and peremptory air, 
<i>which was very dignified</i>, and which seemed to say that he 
rather expected <i>somebody wanted to take advantage of him</i>, 
<i>but it wouldn&rsquo;t do</i>&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;Are you going
to Bath?&rdquo; said the strange man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am, 
sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; &ldquo;And these other 
gentleman?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are going also,&rdquo; said 
Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not inside&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be damned 
if you&rsquo;re going inside,&rdquo; said the strange man.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Not all of us,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No&mdash;not all of you,&rdquo; said the strange man, 
emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;We take two places.&nbsp; If they try 
and squeeze six people <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>into an infernal box that only holds 
four I&rsquo;ll take a post-chaise and bring an action.&nbsp; It 
won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; This recalls the pleasant story
about Forster and the cabman who summoned him.&nbsp; The latter 
was adjudged to be in the wrong and said he knew it, but 
&ldquo;that he was determined to show him up, he were <i>such a 
harbitrary cove</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; None enjoyed this story more 
than Forster himself, and I have heard him say to a lady 
humorously, &ldquo;Now you must.&nbsp; You know I am &lsquo;such 
a harbitrary cove.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Dear good old Forster!</p>
<p>I must confess all Pickwickians would like to know 
biographical details, as one might call them, about the 
personages engaged in the trial.&nbsp; I need not repeat that 
Judge Stareleigh was drawn from Mr. Justice Gazalee, or that 
Buzfuz was founded on Mr. Serjeant Bompas, or Bumpus.&nbsp; 
Charles Carpenter Bompas was his full designation.&nbsp; He was 
made a Serjeant in 1827, the very year of the memorable 
trial.&nbsp; He obtained a Patent of Precedence in 1834.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Buzfuz&rsquo;s son&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. <!-- page 77--><a 
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>W. Bompas, 
Q.C., who will pardon the freedom of the designation&mdash;was 
born in the year of the celebrated trial.&nbsp; He was the 
youngest son and had a very distinguished career both at College 
and at the Bar, being a &ldquo;leader&rdquo; on his circuit, 
revising barrister, bencher, recorder, and was last year 
appointed a County Court judge.</p>
<p>Who were Serjeant Snubbin, Skimpin, and Phunkey?&nbsp; No 
traditions have come to us as to these gentlemen.&nbsp; Skimpin 
may have been Wilkins, and Snubbin a Serjeant Arabin, a 
contemporary of Buzfuz.&nbsp; But we are altogether in the 
dark.</p>
<p>We should have liked also to have some &ldquo;prehistoric 
peeps&rdquo; at the previous biography of Mr. Pickwick before the
story began.&nbsp; We have but a couple of indications of his 
calling: the allusion by Perker at the close of the 
story&mdash;&ldquo;The agent at Liverpool said he had been 
obliged to you many times when you were in business.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was therefore a merchant or in trade.&nbsp; Snubbin at the 
trial <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>stated that &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick had 
retired from business and was a gentleman of considerable 
independent property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the original announcement of the &ldquo;Pickwick 
Papers&rdquo; there are some scraps of information about Mr. 
Pickwick and the Club itself.&nbsp; This curious little screed 
shows that the programme was much larger than the one carried 
out:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>&ldquo;The Pickwick Club, so renowned
in the annals of Huggin Lane, and so closely entwined with the 
thousand interesting associations connected with Lothbury and 
Cateaton Street, was founded in the year one thousand eight 
hundred and twenty-two, by Samuel Pickwick&mdash;the great 
traveller&mdash;whose fondness for the useful arts prompted his 
celebrated journey to Birmingham in the depth of winter; and 
whose taste for the beauties of nature even led him to penetrate 
to the very borders of Wales in the height of summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This remarkable man would appear to have infused a 
considerable portion of his restless and inquiring spirit into 
the breasts of other members of the Club, and to have awakened in
their minds the same insatiable thirst for travel which so 
eminently characterized his own.&nbsp; The whole surface of 
Middlesex, a part of Surrey, a portion of Essex, and several 
square miles of Kent were in their turns examined and reported 
on.&nbsp; In a rapid steamer they smoothly navigated the placid 
Thames; and in an open boat they fearlessly crossed the turbid 
Medway.&nbsp; High-roads <!-- page 80--><a 
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and by-roads,
towns and villages, public conveyances and their passengers, 
first-rate inns and road-side public houses, races, fairs, 
regattas elections, meetings, market days&mdash;all the scenes 
that can possibly occur to enliven a country place, and at which 
different traits of character may be observed and recognized, 
were alike visited and beheld by the ardent Pickwick and his 
enthusiastic followers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pickwick Travels, the Pickwick Diary, the Pickwick 
Correspondence&mdash;in short, the whole of the Pickwick 
Papers&rsquo;&mdash;were carefully preserved, and duly registered
by the secretary, from time to time, in the voluminous 
Transactions of the Pickwick Club.&nbsp; These Transactions have 
been purchased from the patriotic secretary, at an immense 
expense, and placed in the hands of &lsquo;Boz,&rsquo; the author
of &ldquo;Sketches Illustrative of Every Day Life and Every Day 
People&rdquo;&mdash;a gentleman whom the publishers consider 
highly qualified for the task of arranging these important 
documents, and placing them before the public in an attractive 
form.&nbsp; He is at present deeply <!-- page 81--><a 
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>immersed in 
his arduous labours, the first fruits of which will appear on the
31st March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seymour has devoted himself, heart and graver, to the 
task of illustrating the beauties of Pickwick.&nbsp; It was 
reserved to Gibbon to paint, in colours that will never fade, the
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&mdash;to Hume to chronicle 
the strife and turmoil of the two proud houses that divided 
England against herself&mdash;to Napier to pen, in burning words,
the History of the War in the Peninsula&mdash;the deeds and 
actions of the gifted Pickwick yet remain for &lsquo;Boz&rsquo; 
and Seymour to hand down to posterity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the present appearance of these important 
documents and the probable extent of the selections from them, it
is presumed that the series will be completed in about twenty 
numbers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this it will be seen that it was intended to exhibit all 
the humours of the social amusements with which the public 
regaled itself.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick and friends were to be shown 
on board a steamer; at races, fairs, regattas, market days, 
meetings&mdash;&ldquo;at all the scenes that can possibly occur 
to enliven a <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>country place, and at which different
traits of character may be observed and recognized.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
This was a very scientific and well drawn scheme; and it was, on 
the whole, most faithfully and even brilliantly carried 
out.&nbsp; But with infinite art Boz emancipated himself from the
formal hide-bound trammels of Syntax tours and the like, when it 
was reckoned that the hero and his friends would be exhibited 
like &ldquo;Bob Logic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tom and Jerry&rdquo; in a
regular series of public places.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick has an
Adventure at Vauxhall,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick Goes to 
Margate,&rdquo; etc.: we had a narrow escape, it would seem, of 
this conventional sort of thing, and no doubt it was this the 
publishers looked for.&nbsp; But &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; asserted his 
supremacy, and made the narrative the chief element.</p>
<p>It was interesting thus to know that Mr. Pickwick had visited 
the borders of Wales&mdash;I suppose, Chester&mdash;but what was 
his celebrated journey to Birmingham, prompted by his 
&ldquo;fondness for the useful arts&rdquo;?&nbsp; This <!-- page 
83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>could
hardly refer to his visit to Mr. Winkle, sen.&nbsp; The Club, it 
will be seen, was founded in 1822, and its place of meeting would
appear to have been this Huggin Lane, City, &ldquo;so intimately 
associated with Lothbury and Cateaton Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
picture of the meeting of the Club shows us that it consisted of 
the ominous number of <i>thirteen</i>.&nbsp; There is not room 
for more.&nbsp; They seem like a set of well-to-do retired 
tradesmen; the faces are such as we should see on the stage in a 
piece of low comedy: for the one on the left Mr. Edward Terry 
might have sat.&nbsp; The secretary sits at the bottom of the 
table, with his back to us, and the chairman, with capacious 
stomach, at the top.&nbsp; Blotton, whom Mr. Pickwick rather 
unhandsomely described as a &ldquo;vain and disappointed 
haberdasher,&rdquo; may have followed this business.&nbsp; He is 
an ill-looking fellow enough, with black, bushy whiskers.&nbsp; 
The Pickwickians are decidedly the most gentlemanly of the 
party.&nbsp; But why was it necessary for Mr. Pickwick to stand 
upon a chair?&nbsp; <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>This, however, may have been a custom
of the day at free and easy meetings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Posthumous <i>papers</i>&rdquo;&mdash;moreover, did not
correctly describe the character of the Book, for the narrative 
did not profess to be founded on documents at all.&nbsp; He was, 
however, committed to this title by his early announcement, and 
indeed intended to carry out a device of using Snodgrass&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Note Books,&rdquo; whose duty it was during the course of 
the adventures to take down diligently all that he 
observed.&nbsp; But this cumbrous fiction was discarded after a 
couple of numbers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Posthumous papers&rdquo; had been
used some ten years before, in another work.</p>
<p>Almost every page&mdash;save perhaps a dismal story or 
two&mdash;in the 609 pages of Pickwick is good; but there are two
or three passages which are obscure, if not forced in 
humour.&nbsp; Witness Mr. Bantam&rsquo;s recognition of Mr. 
Pickwick, as the gentleman residing on Clapham Green&mdash;not 
yet Common&mdash;&ldquo;who <!-- page 85--><a 
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>lost the use 
of his limbs from imprudently taking cold after port wine, who 
could not be moved in consequence of acute suffering, and who had
the water from the King&rsquo;s Bath bottled at 103 degrees, and 
<i>sent by waggon to his bedroom in Town</i>; when he bathed, 
sneezed, and same day recovered.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is grotesque 
enough and farcical, but without much meaning.&nbsp; On another 
occasion we are told that Tupman was casting certain 
&ldquo;<i>Anti</i>-Pickwickian glances&rdquo; at the servant 
maids, which is unmeaning.&nbsp; No doubt, <i>Un</i>-Pickwickian 
was intended.</p>
<p>Why is there no &ldquo;Pickwick Club&rdquo; in London?&nbsp; 
It might be worth trying, and would be more successful than even 
the Johnson Club.&nbsp; There is surely genuine 
&ldquo;stuff&rdquo; to work on.&nbsp; Our friends in America, who
are Pickwickian <i>quand m&ecirc;me</i>, have established the 
&ldquo;All-Around Dickens Club.&rdquo;&nbsp; The members seem to 
be ladies, though there are a number of honorary members of the 
other sex, which include members <!-- page 86--><a 
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>of 
&ldquo;Boz&rsquo;s&rdquo; own family, with Mr. Kitton, Mr. W. 
Hughes, Mr. Charles Kent, myself, and some more.&nbsp; The device
of the club is &ldquo;Boz&rsquo;s&rdquo; own book-plate, and the 
&ldquo;flower&rdquo; of the club is his favourite geranium.&nbsp;
The President is Mrs. Adelaide Garland; and some very interesting
papers, to judge from their titles, have been read, such as 
&ldquo;Bath and its Associations with Landor,&rdquo; &ldquo;The 
City of Bristol with its Literary Associations,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Excursion to the Tea Gardens of Hampstead,&rdquo; prefaced by a 
description of the historic old inn, &ldquo;Poem by Charles 
Kent,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dickens at Gad&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo; &ldquo;A 
Description of Birmingham, its Institutions, and Dickens&rsquo; 
Interest therein&rdquo;; with a &ldquo;Reading of Mr. 
Pickwick&rsquo;s Mission to Birmingham, Coventry and the adjacent
Warwickshire Country,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; There is also a very 
clever series of examination questions by the President in 
imitation of Calverley&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had Mr. Pickwick loved?&rdquo; Mr. Lang asks; &ldquo;it
is natural to believe that he had never proposed, never.&nbsp; 
His heart, however <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>bruised, was neither broken nor 
embittered.&rdquo;&nbsp; His temperament was certainly 
affectionate&mdash;if not absolutely amatory: he certainly never 
missed an opportunity where a kiss was practicable.</p>
<p>But stay! has anyone noted that on the wall of his room at 
Dulwich, there hangs the portrait of a lady&mdash;just over this 
might seem to mean something.&nbsp; But on looking close, we see 
it is the dear filial old fellow&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; A striking
likeness, and she has spectacles like her celebrated son.</p>
<p>As all papers connected with the Pickwick era are scarce and 
meagre&mdash;for the reason that no one was then thinking of 
&ldquo;Boz&rdquo;; any that have come down to us are specially 
interesting.&nbsp; Here are a few &ldquo;pieces,&rdquo; which 
will be welcomed by all Pickwickians.&nbsp; The first is a letter
of our author to his publishers.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Furnival&rsquo;s 
Inn,<br />
&ldquo;Friday Morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am very 
glad to find I shall have the pleasure of celebrating Mr. 
Pickwick&rsquo;s <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>success with you on Sunday.&nbsp; 
When you have sufficiently recovered from the fatigues of 
publication, will you just let me know from your books how we 
stand.&nbsp; Drawing &pound;10 one day, and &pound;20 another, 
and so forth, I have become rather mystified, and jumbled up our 
accounts in my brain, in a very incomprehensible state.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Faithfully yours,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This must have been written at the conclusion of the story in 
1837, and is in a very modest tone considering how triumphant had
been the success.&nbsp; Connected with this is a paper of yet 
more interest, a receipt for payment for one of the early 
numbers.</p>

</a></p>
<p>For this Pickwickian Banquet, he had reluctantly to give up 
one at the home of his new friend Forster.&nbsp; In an 
unpublished letter, he writes to him as &ldquo;Dear 
Sir&rdquo;&mdash;the beginning of a four-and-thirty years&rsquo; 
friendship&mdash;&ldquo;I have been so much engaged in the 
pleasing occupation of moving.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was unable to go 
to his new friend to dinner <!-- page 89--><a 
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>because he 
had been &ldquo;long engaged to the Pickwick publishers to a 
dinner in honour of that hero, which comes off 
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an interesting letter of Dickens&rsquo;&mdash;Pickwickian 
ones are rare&mdash;sold at Hodgson&rsquo;s rooms, July, 1895, he
writes: &ldquo;Mr. Seymour shot himself before the second number 
of the Pickwick papers, not the third as you would have it, was 
published.&nbsp; While he lay dead, it was necessary the search 
should be made in his working room for the plates to the second 
number, the day for publication of which was drawing near.&nbsp; 
The plates were found unfinished, with their faces turned to the 
wall.&rdquo;&nbsp; This scrap brought &pound;12 10s.&nbsp; 
Apropos of prices, who that was present will forget the scene at 
Christie&rsquo;s when the six &ldquo;Pickwick Ladles&rdquo; were 
sold?&nbsp; These were quaint things, like enlarged Apostle 
Spoons, and the figures well modelled.&nbsp; They had been made 
specially, and presented to &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; on the conclusion 
of his story, by his publishers.&nbsp; The Pickwick <!-- page 
90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Ladle
brought &pound;69.&nbsp; Jingle, &pound;30.&nbsp; Winkle, 
&pound;23.&nbsp; Sam, &pound;64.&nbsp; Old Weller, &pound;51; and
the Fat Boy, &pound;35 14s., or over &pound;280 in all.&nbsp; 
Nay, the leather case was put up, and brought three 
guineas.&nbsp; We recall Andrew Halliday displaying one to us, 
with a sort of triumph.&nbsp; Charles Dickens, the younger, got 
two, I think; Messrs. Agnew the others.</p>
<h2><!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
91</span>CONCERNING THE PLATES AND EXTRA PLATES AND 
&ldquo;STATES&rdquo; OF PICKWICK.</h2>
<p>It is an interesting question what should be the relation of 
illustration to the story, and of the artist to the story-teller;
and what are the limitations of their respective provinces.&nbsp;
Both should work independently of each other; that is, the artist
should tell the story from his own point of view&mdash;he is not 
merely to servilely translate the situations into &ldquo;black 
and white.&rdquo;&nbsp; He should be, in fact, what the actor is 
to a drama.&nbsp; When Eugene Delacroix&rsquo;s illustrations to 
Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; were shown to the great 
author, he expressed admiration of their truth and spirit; and on
his secretary saying that they would lead to a better 
understanding of his poem, said: &ldquo;With that we have naught 
to do; on the contrary, the more complete imagination of such an 
artist compels us to <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>believe that the situations as he 
represents them are preferable to them as described.&nbsp; It is 
therefore likely that the readers will find that he exerts a 
strong force upon their imagination.&rdquo;&nbsp; This shows, 
allowing something for the compliment, what a distinct force the 
great writer attributed to the artist, that he did not consider 
him an assistant or merely subsidiary.&nbsp; The actor becomes, 
after his fashion, a distinct creator and originator, supplying 
details, etc., of his own, but taking care that these are 
consistent with the text and do not contradict it in any way.</p>
<p>This large treatment was exactly 
&ldquo;Phiz&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; He seems to &ldquo;act&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Boz&rsquo;s&rdquo; drama, yet he did not introduce 
anything that was not warranted by the spirit of the text.&nbsp; 
He found himself present at the scene, and felt how it 
<i>must</i> have occurred.&nbsp; He had a wonderful power of 
selecting what was essential and what should be essential.&nbsp; 
Nor did he make a minute inventory of such details as were 
mentioned in the text.&nbsp; Hence the extraordinary <!-- page 
93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
93</span>vitality and spirit of his work.&nbsp; There is action 
in all, and each picture tells its own story.&nbsp; To see the 
merit of this system, we have only to contrast with it such 
attempts as we find in modern productions, where the 
artist&rsquo;s method is to present to us figures grouped 
together, apparently talking but not <i>acting</i>&mdash;such 
things as we have week by week in <i>Punch</i>.&nbsp; The late 
Sir John Millais and other artists of almost equal rank used to 
furnish illustrations to serial stories, and all their pictures 
were of this kind&mdash;two or three figures&mdash;well drawn, 
certainly&mdash;one standing, the others sitting down, it may be,
engaged in conversation.&nbsp; This brought us &ldquo;no 
forrarder&rdquo; and supplied no dramatic interest.</p>
<p>It should be said, however, that it is only to 
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; that this high praise can be 
extended.&nbsp; With every succeeding story the character of the 
work seemed to fall off, or rather the methods of the artist to 
change.&nbsp; It may have been, too, the inspiration from a <!-- 
page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
94</span>dramatic spirited story also failed, for 
&ldquo;Boz&rdquo; had abandoned the free, almost reckless style 
of his first tale.&nbsp; There was a living distinctness, too, in
the Pickwickian <i>coterie</i>, and every figure, familiar and 
recognizable, seemed to have infinite possibilities.&nbsp; The 
very look of them would inspire.</p>
<p>In this spirit of vitality and reality also, 
&ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; rather suggests a famous foreign illustrator, 
Chodowiecki, who a century ago was in enormous request for the 
illustration of books of all kinds, and whose groups and figures,
drawn with much spirit and roundness, arrested the eye at once 
and told the situation.&nbsp; Later &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; fell off 
in his work and indeed adopted quite new and more commercial 
methods, such as would enable him to get through the vast amount 
of work that came to him.&nbsp; There were no longer these 
telling situations to limn which spoke for themselves, and 
without straw, bricks are not to be made.&nbsp; In this later 
manner we seem to have bid adieu to the inspiration&mdash;to <!--
page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
95</span>the fine old <i>round</i> style of drawing&mdash;where 
the figures &ldquo;stand out&rdquo; completely.&nbsp; He adopted 
a sort of sketchy fashion; his figures became silhouettes and 
quite flat.&nbsp; There was also a singular carelessness in 
finish&mdash;a mere outline served for a face.&nbsp; The result 
was a monotony and similarity of treatment, with a certain 
unreality and grotesqueness which are like nothing in life.&nbsp;
In this, however, he may have been inspired by the grotesque 
personages he was put to illustrate&mdash;the Smallweeds and the 
like.</p>
<p>It would be an interesting speculation to consider what would 
have become of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; had this artist not been 
forthcoming.&nbsp; Would we have really known our Mr. Pickwick 
and his &ldquo;followers&rdquo; as we do now, or, indeed, would 
we have so keenly appreciated the humorous situations?&nbsp; I 
believe not.&nbsp; It was the graven figures of these personages,
and the brilliant way in which the situations were concentrated, 
as it were, into a point, that produced such striking <!-- page 
96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
96</span>effect: without these adjuncts the Head of the Club and 
his friends would have been more or less abstractions, very much 
what the characters in Theodore Hook&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gilbert 
Gurney&rdquo; are.&nbsp; Take Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; The author 
supplied only a few hints as to his personal appearance&mdash;he 
was bald, mild, pale, wore spectacles and gaiters; but who would 
have imagined him as we have him now, with his high forehead, 
bland air, protuberant front.&nbsp; The same with the 
others.&nbsp; Mr. Thackeray tried in many ways to give some 
corporeal existence to his own characters to &ldquo;Becky,&rdquo;
Pendennis, and others; but who sees them as we do Mr. 
Pickwick?&nbsp; So with his various 
&ldquo;situations&rdquo;&mdash;many most dramatic and effective, 
but no one would guess it from the etchings.&nbsp; The Pickwick 
scenes all tell a story of their own; and a person&mdash;say a 
foreigner&mdash;who had never even heard of the story would 
certainly smile over the situations, and be piqued into 
speculating what could be the ultimate meaning.</p>

97</span>At the exhibition &ldquo;illustrating a century and a 
half of English humorists,&rdquo; given by the Fine Art 
Society&mdash;under the direction of Mr. Joseph Grego&mdash;in 
October, 1896, there was a collection of original Pickwick 
drawings no less than fifty-six in number.&nbsp; There were three
by Seymour, two by Bass and thirty-four by Phiz, all used in the 
book; while of those unused&mdash;probably found unsuitable, 
there were five by Buss, including a proposed title-page, and two
of the Fat Boy &ldquo;awake on this occasion only.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
There were also five by Phiz, which were not engraved, and one by
Leech.&nbsp; The drawing of the dying clown, Seymour was engaged 
upon when he committed suicide.&nbsp; Of Buss&rsquo; there were 
two of Mr. Pickwick at the Review, two of the cricket match, two 
of the Fat Boy &ldquo;awake,&rdquo; &ldquo;the influence of the 
salmon&rdquo;&mdash;unused, &ldquo;Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s first 
shot&rdquo;&mdash;unused, studies of character in Pickwick, and a
study for the title-page.&nbsp; The poor, discarded Buss took a 
vast deal of pains therefore to accomplish <!-- page 98--><a 
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>his 
task.&nbsp; Of Phiz&rsquo;s unused designs there was &ldquo;Mr. 
Winkle&rsquo;s first shot&rdquo; and two for the Gabriel Grub 
story, also one for &ldquo;the Warden&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Most interesting of all was his &ldquo;original study&rdquo; for 
the figure of Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>Mr. Grego, himself an excellent artist, placed at the door of 
the society a very telling figure of Mr. Pickwick displayed on a 
poster and effectively coloured.&nbsp; It was new to find our 
genial old friend smiling an invitation to us&mdash;in Bond 
Street.&nbsp; This&mdash;which I took for a lithographed 
&ldquo;poster&rdquo;&mdash;was Mr. Grego&rsquo;s own work, 
portrayed in water colours.</p>
<p>There have been many would-be illustrators of the chronicle, 
some on original lines of their own; but these must be on the 
whole pronounced to be failures.&nbsp; On looking at them we 
somehow feel that the figures and situations are wholly strange 
to us; that we don&rsquo;t know them or recognize them.&nbsp; The
reason is possibly that the artists are not in perfect sympathy 
or intelligence with the <!-- page 99--><a 
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>story; they 
do not know every turning, corner and cranny of it, as did 
&ldquo;Phiz&rdquo;&mdash;and indeed as did everyone else living 
at that time; they were not inspired, above all, by its 
author.&nbsp; But there was a more serious reason still for the 
failure.&nbsp; It will be seen that in Phiz&rsquo;s wonderful 
plates the faces and figures are more or less 
<i>generalized</i>.&nbsp; We cannot tell exactly, for instance, 
what were Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s or even Sam Weller&rsquo;s 
features.&nbsp; Neither their mouths, eyes, or noses, could be 
put in distinct shape.&nbsp; We have only the general air and 
tone and suggestion&mdash;as of persons seen afar off in a 
crowd.&nbsp; Yet they are always recognizable.&nbsp; This is art,
and it gave the artist a greater freedom in his treatment.&nbsp; 
Now when an illustrator like the late Frederick Barnard came, he 
drew his Jingle, his Pickwick, Weller, and Winkle, with 
<i>all</i> their features, in quite a literal and particular 
fashion&mdash;the features were minutely and carefully brought 
out, with the result that they seem almost strange to us.&nbsp; 
Nor do they express <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>the characters.&nbsp; There 
<i>is</i> an expression, but it seems not the one to which we are
accustomed.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick is generally shown as a rather 
&ldquo;cranky&rdquo; and testy old gentleman in his expressions, 
whereas the note of all &ldquo;Phiz&rsquo;s&rdquo; faces is a 
good softness and unctuousness even.&nbsp; Now this somewhat 
philosophical analysis points to a principle in art illustration 
which accounts in a great measure for the unsatisfactory results 
where it is attempted to illustrate familiar works&mdash;such as 
those of Tennyson, Shakespeare, etc.&nbsp; The reader has a fixed
idea before him, which he has formed for himself&mdash;an 
indistinct, shapeless one it might be, but still of sufficient 
outline to be disturbed.&nbsp; Among the innumerable presentments
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s heroines no one has ever seen any that 
satisfied or that even corresponded.&nbsp; They are usually not 
generalized enough.&nbsp; Again, the readers of 
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; grew month by month, or number by number, 
more and more acquainted with the characters: <!-- page 101--><a 
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>for the 
figures and faces appeared over and over and yet over again.</p>
<p>The most diverting, however, of all these imitators and 
extra-illustrators is assuredly the artist of the German 
edition.&nbsp; The series is admirably drawn, every figure well 
finished, but figures, faces, and scenes are 
unrecognizable.&nbsp; It is the Frenchman&rsquo;s idea of 
Hamlet.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick and his friends are stout Germans, 
dressed in German garments, sitting in German restaurants with 
long tankards with <i>lids</i> before them.&nbsp; The incidents 
are made as literal and historical as possible.&nbsp; The 
difficulty, of course, was that none of their adventures could 
have occurred in a country like Germany, or if they did, would 
have become an affair of police.&nbsp; No German could see humour
in that.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all this, the true Pickwickian 
will welcome them as a pleasant contribution to the Pickwickian 
humour, and no one would have laughed so loudly at them as Boz 
himself.</p>
<p><!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>The original illustrations form a serious and important
department of Pickwickian lore, and entail an almost 
<i>scientific</i> knowledge.&nbsp; Little, indeed, did the young 
&ldquo;Boz&rdquo; dream, when he was settling with his publishers
that the work was to contain forty-two plates&mdash;an immense 
number it might seem&mdash;that these were to fructify into such 
an enormous progeny.&nbsp; We, begin, of course, with the regular
official plates that belong strictly to the work.&nbsp; Here we 
find three artists at work&mdash;each succeeding the 
other&mdash;the unfortunate Robert Seymour coming first with his 
seven spirited pictures; next the unlucky Buss, with his two 
condemned productions, later to be dismissed from the book 
altogether; and finally, &ldquo;Phiz,&rdquo; or Hablot K. Browne,
who furnished the remaining plates to the end.&nbsp; As is well 
known, so great was the run upon the book that the plates were 
unequal to the duty, and &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; had to re-engrave 
them several times&mdash;often duplicates on the one 
plate&mdash;naturally not copying them <!-- page 103--><a 
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>very 
closely.&nbsp; Hence we have the rather interesting 
&ldquo;variations.&rdquo;&nbsp; He by-and-bye re-engraved 
Seymour&rsquo;s seven, copying them with wonderful exactness, and
finally substituted two of his own for those of the condemned 
Buss.&nbsp; The volume, therefore, was furnished with seven 
Seymours, and their seven replicas, the two Buss&rsquo;s, their 
two replicas, and the thirty-three &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; pictures, 
each with its &ldquo;variation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These variations are very interesting, and even amusing.&nbsp;
On an ordinary careless glance one would hardly detect much 
difference&mdash;the artist, who seemed to wish to have a certain
freedom, made these changes either to amuse himself or as if 
resenting the monotony of copying.&nbsp; In any case they 
represent an amount of patient labour that is quite unique in 
such things.</p>
<p>The Pickwickian &ldquo;student&rdquo; may be glad to go with 
us through some of the plates and have an account of these 
differences.&nbsp; We must premise that the first state of the 
plates <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>may be considered &ldquo;proofs 
before letters&rdquo;&mdash;the descriptive titles being only 
found in the later editions.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Frontispiece.&rdquo;&nbsp; (We shall call 
the second state <i>b</i>, the first <i>a</i>.)&nbsp; In <i>a</i>
the signature &ldquo;Phiz,&rdquo; &ldquo;fct.&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;fecit&rdquo; is on the left, in <i>b</i> it is divided 
half on each side.&nbsp; The harlequin painting has a full face 
in <i>a</i>, a side face in <i>b</i>.&nbsp; The face at the apex 
of the picture has a mouth closed in <i>b</i>, and open in 
<i>a</i>.&nbsp; There are variations in nearly all the grotesque 
faces; and in <i>b</i> the faces of Mr. Pickwick and Sam are 
fuller and more animated.&nbsp; In <i>b</i> the general treatment
of the whole is richer.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Title-page.&rdquo;&nbsp; In <i>a</i> the 
sign has Veller, in <i>b</i> Weller.&nbsp; Old Weller&rsquo;s 
face in <i>b</i> is more resolved and animated; in <i>a</i> water
is flowing from the pail.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick Addressing the Club.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Pickwick in <i>b</i> is more cantankerous than in 
<i>a</i>&mdash;all the faces scarcely correspond in expression, 
though the outlines are the same.&nbsp; The work, shading, etc., 
is much bolder in <i>b</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>4.&nbsp; &ldquo;Scene with the Cabman.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Very little difference between the plates, save in the spectacles
lying on the ground.&nbsp; These are trivialities.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Sagacious Dog.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>b</i> is 
more heavily shaded, but <i>a</i> is much superior in the dog and
face of the sportsman.&nbsp; Trees in <i>b</i> more 
elaborate.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dr. Slammer&rsquo;s Defiance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
figures on the top of the stairs are much darker and bolder in 
<i>b</i>.&nbsp; Jingle&rsquo;s and Tupman&rsquo;s faces are 
better in <i>b</i> than in <i>a</i>, and Jingle&rsquo;s legs are 
better drawn in <i>b</i>.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Dying Clown.&rdquo;&nbsp; A most dramatic 
and tragic conception, which shows that Seymour would have been 
invaluable later on for Dickens&rsquo; more serious work.&nbsp; 
The chief differences are in the face of the man at his bedside 
and the candle.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick in Search of his 
Hat.&rdquo;&nbsp; The drawing of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s legs is 
rather strange.&nbsp; The right leg could hardly be so much 
twisted back while Mr. Pickwick runs <!-- page 106--><a 
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>straight 
forward; his left hand or arm is obscure in both.&nbsp; All the 
faces differ&mdash;the hat in <i>b</i> has much more the look of 
being blown along than that in <i>a</i>.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Winkle Soothes a Refractory 
Steed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seymour&rsquo;s horse is infinitely more 
spirited and better drawn than Phiz&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Its struggling
attitude is admirable.&nbsp; Seymour&rsquo;s landscape is touched
more delicately; the faces differ in both.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Cricket Match.&rdquo;&nbsp; First Buss 
plate.&nbsp; He introduced a farcical incident not in the 
text&mdash;the ball knocking off the fielder&rsquo;s hat, who is 
quite close to the batsman.&nbsp; A very poor production.&nbsp; 
Observe the &ldquo;antediluvian&rdquo; shape of the bat&mdash;no 
paddings on the legs.&nbsp; The sketch is valuable as showing how
<i>not</i> to interpret Dickens&rsquo; humour, or rather how to 
interpret it in a strictly <i>literal</i> way&mdash;that is, 
without humour.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tupman in the Arbour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Second 
Buss plate&mdash;rather ostentatiously signed &ldquo;Drawn and 
etched by R. W. Buss.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 107--><a 
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>Tupman 
appears to be tumbling over Miss Wardle.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; The same subject by &ldquo;Phiz.&rdquo;&nbsp; A 
remarkable contrast in treatment; there is the suggestion of the 
pair being surprised.&nbsp; We see how the fat boy came on 
them.&nbsp; The old Manor Farm in the background, with its 
gables, etc., is a pleasing addition, and like all 
&ldquo;Phiz&rsquo;s&rdquo; landscapes, delicately touched 
in.&nbsp; The scared alarm on the two faces is 
first-rate&mdash;even Miss Wardle&rsquo;s foot as well as 
Tupman&rsquo;s is expressive.&nbsp; There appears to be no 
&ldquo;variation&rdquo; of this plate.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Influence of the Salmon.&rdquo;&nbsp; A 
truly dramatic group overflowing with humour.&nbsp; Note no fewer
than ten faces in the background, servants, etc., all expressing 
interest according to their class and degree.&nbsp; The five 
chief characters express drunkenness in five different fashions: 
the hopeless, combative, despairing, affectionate, etc.&nbsp; 
Wardle&rsquo;s stolid calm is good.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Breakdown.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was 
&ldquo;Phiz&rsquo;s&rdquo; <!-- page 108--><a 
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span><i>coup 
d&rsquo;essai</i> after he was called in, and is a most spirited 
piece.&nbsp; But the variations make the second plate almost a 
new one.&nbsp; The drawing, grouping, etc., in <i>b</i> are an 
enormous improvement, and supply life and animation.&nbsp; The 
three figures, Pickwick, Wardle, and the postillion, are all 
altered for the better.&nbsp; In <i>b</i> Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s 
nervousness, as he is extricated from the chaise, is well 
shown.&nbsp; The postillion becomes a round spirited figure, 
instead of a mere sketch; Wardle, as in the text, instead of 
stooping down and merely showing his back, is tramping about 
gesticulating.&nbsp; A very spirited white horse is introduced 
with a postillion as spirited; the single chaise in the distance,
the horses drawn back, and Jingle stretching out, is 
admirable.&nbsp; It is somehow conveyed in a clever way in 
<i>b</i> that Miss Wardle is peeping through the hind window at 
the scene.&nbsp; There is a wheel on the ground in <i>b</i>, and 
one hat; in <i>a</i> there are two hats&mdash;Mr. 
Pickwick&rsquo;s, which is recognizable, and Wardle&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>15.&nbsp; &ldquo;First Appearance of Mr. S. 
Weller.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the first issue a faint 
&ldquo;Nemo&rdquo; can be made out in the corner, and it is said 
the same signature is on the preceding plate, though I have never
been able to trace it clearly.&nbsp; This plate, as is well 
known, represents the court of the Old White Hart Inn in the 
Borough, which was pulled down some years ago.&nbsp; On this 
background&mdash;the galleries, etc., being picturesquely 
indicated&mdash;stand out brilliantly the four figures.&nbsp; The
plate was varied in important ways.&nbsp; In the <i>b</i> version
some fine effects of light and shade are brought out by the aid 
of the loaded cart and Wardle&rsquo;s figure.&nbsp; 
Wardle&rsquo;s hat is changed from a common round one to a low 
broad-leafed one, his figure made stouter, and he is clothed with
dark instead of white breeches, his face broadened and made more 
good-humoured.&nbsp; Sam&rsquo;s face in <i>b</i> is made much 
more like the ideal Sam; that in <i>a</i> is grotesque.&nbsp; 
Perker&rsquo;s face and attitude are altered in <i>b</i>, where 
he is made more interrogative.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick in <i>b</i> is 
<!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
110</span>much more placid and bland than in <i>a</i>, and he 
carries his hat more jauntily.&nbsp; Top-boots in <i>b</i> are 
introduced among those which Sam is cleaning.&nbsp; He, oddly, 
seems to be cleaning a <i>white</i> boot.&nbsp; A capital dog in 
<i>b</i> is sniffing at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s leg; in <i>a</i> 
there is a rather unmeaning skulking animal.&nbsp; All the 
smaller figures are altered.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Bardell Faints.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first 
plate is feeble and ill-drawn, though Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s and 
Tupman&rsquo;s faces are good, the latter somewhat farcical; the 
boy &ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; is decidedly bad and too small.&nbsp; Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s face in <i>a</i> is better than in 
<i>b</i>.&nbsp; In the second attempt all is bolder and more 
spirited.&nbsp; The three Pickwickians are made to express 
astonishment, even in their legs.&nbsp; There is a table-desk in 
<i>a</i>, not in <i>b</i>.&nbsp; A clock and two vases are 
introduced, and a picture over the mirror representing a sleeping
beauty with a cupid.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Election at Eatanswill.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
first plate represents an election riot in front <!-- page 
111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>of
the hustings, which is wild and fairly spirited.&nbsp; But no 
doubt it appeared somewhat confused to the artist.&nbsp; In his 
second he made it quite another matter.&nbsp; Over the hustings 
he introduced a glimpse of the old Ipswich gables.&nbsp; He 
changed the figure and dress of Fizkin, the rival 
candidate.&nbsp; He had Perker sitting on the rail, but 
substituted a standing-up figure, talking&mdash;presumably 
Perker, but taller than that gentleman.&nbsp; In <i>b</i>, Mr. 
Pickwick&rsquo;s face expresses astonishment at the disorder; in 
<i>a</i> he is mildly placid.&nbsp; In <i>b</i> the figure behind
Mr. Pickwick is turned into Sam by placing a cockade on his 
hat.&nbsp; Next to Fizkin is a new portly figure 
introduced.&nbsp; The figures in the crowd are changed in 
wholesale fashion, and yet the &ldquo;root idea&rdquo; in both is
the same.&nbsp; An artist, we fancy, would learn much from these 
contrasts, seeing how strikingly &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; could shift 
his characters.&nbsp; In the first draft there was not sufficient
movement.&nbsp; To the left there was a stout sailor in a striped
jacket who was thrusting a pole into the chest of a thin <!-- 
page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
112</span>man in check trousers.&nbsp; This, as drawn, seemed too
tranquil, and he substituted a stouter, more jovial figure with 
gymnastic action&mdash;the second was made more contrasted.&nbsp;
Next him was a confused group&mdash;a man with a paper cap, in 
place of which he supplied a stout man on whom the other was 
driven back, and who was being pushed from behind.&nbsp; The 
animation of the background is immensely increased by hats, and 
arms, and sticks being waved.&nbsp; Everything is bolder and 
clearer.&nbsp; The second trombone player, however, is not so 
spirited as the first, and the drum-beater becomes rather a 
&ldquo;Punch and Judy&rdquo; showman.&nbsp; An artistic effect of
light is produced by this drum.&nbsp; There are a great many more
boards, too, introduced in <i>b</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s Fancy dress 
D&eacute;jeun&eacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp; In <i>b</i> the finish and 
treatment are infinitely improved.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s 
face and figure is more refined and artistic.&nbsp; The way he 
holds his hat in his right hand and his left also are improved; 
both are more extended.&nbsp; Mr. <!-- page 113--><a 
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
113</span>Snodgrass&rsquo;s left leg is brought behind Mr. 
Pickwick&rsquo;s in <i>b</i>.&nbsp; Water&mdash;a pond 
perhaps&mdash;is in front.&nbsp; Tupman&rsquo;s hat is altered in
<i>b</i>, and feathers added; his face is more serious and less 
grotesque.&nbsp; Mrs. Pott is more piquant, as the author 
suggested to the artist.&nbsp; The birdcage, instead of being 
high in the tree, is lowered and hangs from it.&nbsp; The most 
curious change is that of Pott, who in <i>a</i> is out of all 
scale, seeming to be about seven feet high.&nbsp; He was lowered 
in <i>b</i>, and given a beard and a more hairy cap.&nbsp; It was
said, indeed, that the original face was too like Lord 
Brougham&rsquo;s, but the reason for the change was probably what
I have given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Young Ladies&rsquo; Seminary.&rdquo;&nbsp; All 
details are changed.&nbsp; The rather &ldquo;cranky&rdquo; face 
of Mr. Pickwick, utterly unlike him, was improved and restored to
its natural benevolence; more detail put into the faces, notably 
the cook&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The girls are made more distinct and 
attractive&mdash;the lady principal at the back made effective; 
all the foliage treated <!-- page 114--><a 
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
114</span>differently, a tree on the left removed.&nbsp; In 
<i>a</i> there is a sort of hook on the inside of the door to 
hold a bell, which is absent; in <i>b</i> it is added.&nbsp; The 
bolts, etc., are different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick in the Pound.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>b</i> is 
more brilliant and vastly improved; the smaller donkey is 
removed, the three reduced to two; the sweep&rsquo;s cap is made 
<i>white</i>; the faces are altered, and made more 
animated.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s figure in the barrow is 
perhaps <i>not</i> improved, but his face is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick in the Attorney&rsquo;s 
Office.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sam&rsquo;s face in <i>a</i> was quite 
unlike, and was improved; the position of his legs altered.&nbsp;
The other points are much the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last Visit of Heyland to the Old Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
is a sort of anticipation of &ldquo;Phiz&rsquo;s&rdquo; later 
treatment of tragic subjects, as supplied for &ldquo;Bleak 
House&rdquo; and such stories.&nbsp; Heyling&rsquo;s cloak in 
<i>b</i> is draped over his left arm, the boards of the door are 
outlined differently.&nbsp; In <i>a</i> the face of the old man a
side one, with little expression; in <i>b</i> it was made 
three-quarters, <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>and contorted with horror&mdash;the 
attitude powerfully expressive, indeed.&nbsp; The figures of both
are worth comparing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Double-bedded Room.&rdquo;&nbsp; In <i>b</i> the 
lady&rsquo;s face is refined, and made less of the 
&ldquo;nut-cracker&rdquo; type.&nbsp; The comb is removed, her 
feet are separated, and the figure becomes not ungraceful.&nbsp; 
A white night-gown in <i>b</i> is introduced; in <i>a</i> it is 
her day-gown, and dark; the back of the chair in <i>b</i> is 
treated more ornamentally; in <i>a</i> a plain frilled nightcap 
is hung on the chair, changed in <i>b</i> to a more grotesque and
&ldquo;Gamp-like&rdquo; headgear.&nbsp; Nothing can be better in 
<i>a</i> than the effect of light from the rushlight on the 
floor.&nbsp; This is helped by the lady&rsquo;s figure, which is 
darkened in <i>a</i>, and thrown out by the white curtains 
behind.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s face in <i>a</i> is not good, 
and much improved in <i>b</i>.&nbsp; It will be noted that the 
artist often thus failed in his hero&rsquo;s 
face&mdash;&ldquo;missing his tip,&rdquo; as it were.&nbsp; This 
picture admirably illustrates the artist&rsquo;s power of 
<i>legitimately</i> emphasizing details&mdash;such as <!-- page 
116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
116</span>the night-cap&mdash;to add to the comic situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Weller Attacks the Executive of 
Ipswich.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is scarcely any alteration worth 
notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Job Trotter Encounters Sam.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two plates
are nearly the same, except that Mary&rsquo;s face is made 
prettier.&nbsp; Sam&rsquo;s is improved, and Job Trotter&rsquo;s 
figure and face more marked and spirited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas Eve at Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
changes here are a cat and dog introduced in the foreground in 
<i>b</i>, instead of the dog which in <i>a</i> is between Mr. 
Pickwick and the old lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel Grubb.&rdquo;&nbsp; A face is introduced into a
branch or knot of the tree&mdash;an odd, rather far-fetched 
effect.&nbsp; The effectively outlined church in the background 
is St. Albans Abbey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick Slides.&rdquo;&nbsp; In <i>b</i> Mr. 
Winkle&rsquo;s skates are introduced.&nbsp; In one version there 
are <i>five</i> stakes instead of four, and Miss <!-- page 
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
117</span>Allen&rsquo;s fur boots and feet are depicted 
differently in each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conviviality at Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
two plates correspond almost exactly&mdash;save for a slight 
alteration in the arrangement of the books in the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick Sits for his Portrait.&rdquo;&nbsp; Slight
alterations in the faces and in the bird-cage.&nbsp; The 
arrangement of the panes in the window is also different.&nbsp; 
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s face is made more intelligent.&nbsp; A 
handle is supplied to a pewter pot on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Warden&rsquo;s Room.&rdquo;&nbsp; Almost exactly 
the same in both.&nbsp; But why has Mr. Pickwick his spectacles 
on when just roused from sleep?&nbsp; There is a collar to the 
shirt hanging from the cord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Meeting with Jingle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Very slight 
changes in the faces.&nbsp; The child&rsquo;s face in <i>b</i> is
admirable, and, like one of Cruikshank&rsquo;s miniatures, it 
conveys alarm and grief.&nbsp; The face of the woman watering her
plant is improved.&nbsp; Note the Hogarthian touch of the <!--

118</span>initials carved on the window, sufficiently distinct 
and yet not intrusively so.&nbsp; This is a most skilfully 
grouped and dramatic picture, and properly conveys the 
author&rsquo;s idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ghostly Passenger.&rdquo;&nbsp; This illustration 
of what is one of the best tales of mystery is equally 
picturesque and original.&nbsp; The five figures in front are 
truly remarkable.&nbsp; The elegant interesting figure of the 
woman, the fop with his hat in the air, the bully with the big 
sword, the man with the blunderbuss, and the bewildered rustic, 
to say nothing of the muffled figures on the coach, make up a 
perfect <i>play</i>.&nbsp; There seems a flutter over all; it is 
like, as it was intended to be, a scene in a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winkle Returns under Extraordinary 
Circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is little difference between 
the plates, save as to the details of the objects in the 
cupboard.&nbsp; In <i>b</i> some bottles have been introduced on 
the top shelf.&nbsp; Mrs. Winkle&rsquo;s is a pleasing, graceful 
figure in both, and improved and refined in <i>b</i>.&nbsp; More 
<!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
119</span>spirit, too, is put into Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s figure as
he rises in astonishment.&nbsp; It may be noted what a graceful 
type of womanhood then prevailed, the face being thrown out by 
&ldquo;bands&rdquo; of hair and ringlets, the large spreading 
bonnets and white veils.&nbsp; Mary wears an enormous bonnet or 
hat like her mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sawyer&rsquo;s Mode of Travelling.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
amazing spirit and movement of this picture cannot be too much 
praised.&nbsp; The chaise seems whirling along, so that the 
coach, meeting it, seems embarrassed and striving to get out of 
the way.&nbsp; The Irish family, struggling to keep up with the 
chaise, is inimitable.&nbsp; There are some changes in 
<i>b</i>.&nbsp; The man with the stick behind has a bundle or bag
attached.&nbsp; The mother with her three children is a 
delightful group, and much improved in the second plate.&nbsp; 
The child holding up flowers is admirably drawn.&nbsp; The child 
who has fallen is given a different <!-- page 120--><a 
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>attitude in
<i>b</i>.&nbsp; The dog, too, is slightly altered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rival Editors.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is little change 
made, save that more plates, jugs, etc., are introduced.&nbsp; 
The &ldquo;row&rdquo; is shown with extraordinary spirit.&nbsp; 
Note the grotesque effect of Pott&rsquo;s face, shown through the
cloth that Sam has put over his head.&nbsp; The onions have got 
detached from the hank hung to the ceiling, and are tumbling on 
the combatants, and&mdash;a capital touch this&mdash;the 
blackbird, whose cage has been covered over to secure its repose,
is shown in <i>b</i> dashing against the bars.&nbsp; We might 
ask, however, what does the cook there, and why does she 
&ldquo;trouble herself about the warming-pan&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary and the Fat Boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both plates nearly 
the same, the languishing face of the Fat Boy admirable.&nbsp; 
Mary&rsquo;s figure, as she draws the chair, charming, though 
somewhat stout at the back.&nbsp; The cook is present, and a 
plate laid for her, which is contrary to the text.</p>
<p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&ldquo;Mr. Weller and his Friends Drinking to Mr. 
Pell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Plates almost the same, save for a slight 
alteration in the faces, and a vinegar cruet introduced next to 
Mr. Pell&rsquo;s oysters.&nbsp; Admirable and most original and 
distinct are the figures of the four coachmen, even the one of 
whom we have only a back view.</p>
<p>Perhaps no one of the plates displays Phiz&rsquo;s vivid power
so forcibly as the one of the trial &ldquo;Bardell v. 
Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; Observe the dramatic animation, with the 
difficulty of treating a number of figures seated in regular 
rows.&nbsp; The types of the lawyers are truly admirable.&nbsp; 
In this latter piece there are no less than thirty-five faces, 
all characteristic, showing the peculiar smug and pedantic cast 
of the barristerial lineaments.&nbsp; Note specially the one at 
the end of the third bench who is engrossed in his brief, the 
pair in the centre who are discussing something, the two standing
up.&nbsp; But what is specially excellent is the selection of 
faces for the four counsel concerned in the case.&nbsp; Nothing 
could be more appropriate <!-- page 122--><a 
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>or better 
suit the author&rsquo;s description.&nbsp; What could excel, or 
&ldquo;beat&rdquo; Buzfuz with his puffed, coarse face and 
hulking form?&nbsp; His brother Serjeant has the dried, 
&ldquo;peaked&rdquo; look of the overworked barrister, and though
he is in his wig we recognize him at once, having seen him before
at his chambers.&nbsp; Mr. Phunkey, behind, is the well-meaning 
but incapable performer to be exhibited in his examination of 
Winkle; and Mr. Skimpin is the alert, unscrupulous, wide-awake 
practitioner who &ldquo;made such a hare&rdquo; of Mr. 
Winkle.&nbsp; The composition of this picture is indeed a work of
high art.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick sliding,&rdquo; how admirably caught is
the tone of a genial, frosty day at a country-house, with the 
animation of the spectators&mdash;the charming landscape.&nbsp; 
In the scene of &ldquo;Under the Mistletoe&rdquo; at Manor Farm, 
the Fat Boy, by some mistake of size, cannot be more than five or
six years old, and Tupman is shown on one knee &ldquo;making 
up&rdquo; to one of the young ladies.&nbsp; <!-- page 123--><a 
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Beaux 
seemed to have been very scarce in the district where stout, 
elderly gentlemen were thus privileged.</p>
<p>The curious thing is that hardly a single face of Mr. 
Pickwick&rsquo;s corresponds with its fellows, yet all are 
sufficiently like and recognizable.&nbsp; In the first picture of
the club he is a cantankerous, sour, old fellow, but the artist 
presently mellowed him.&nbsp; The bald, benevolent forehead, the 
portly little figure, the gaiters, eye-glass and ribbon always 
put on expressively, seem his likeness.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Mr. 
Pickwick sliding&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick sitting for 
his portrait in the Fleet&rdquo; have different faces.</p>
<p>There has always been a sort of fascination in tracing out and
identifying the Pickwickian localities.&nbsp; It is astonishing 
the number of persons that have been engrossed with this 
pursuit.&nbsp; Take Muggleton for instance, which seems to have 
hitherto defied all attempts at discovery.&nbsp; The younger 
Charles Dickens fancied that town, Malling, which lies to the 
<!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
124</span>south of Rochester.&nbsp; Mr. Frost, Mr. Hughes, and 
other &ldquo;explorers&rdquo; all have their favourite 
town.&nbsp; I, myself, had fixed on Maidstone as fulfilling the 
necessary conditions of having a Mayor and Corporation; as 
against this choice and that of all the towns that were south of 
Rochester there was always this fact, that Boz describes the 
party going up the street as they left Rochester, a route that 
led them north-east.&nbsp; But the late Miss 
Dickens&mdash;&ldquo;Mamie&rdquo; as she was affectionately 
called&mdash;in her pleasing and very natural little book, 
&ldquo;My Father as I Recall Him,&rdquo; has casually dropped a 
hint which puts us on the right track.&nbsp; When driving with 
her on the &ldquo;beautiful back road to Cobham once, he pointed 
out a spot.&nbsp; There it was, he said, where Mr. Pickwick 
dropped his whip.&rdquo;&nbsp; The distressed travellers had to 
walk some twelve or fourteen miles&mdash;about the distance of 
Muggleton&mdash;which was important enough to have a Mayor and 
Corporation, etc.&nbsp; We ourselves have walked this road, and 
it led us to&mdash;Gravesend.&nbsp; <!-- page 125--><a 
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Gravesend 
we believe to be Muggleton&mdash;against all competitors.&nbsp; 
Further, when chasing Jingle, Wardle went straight from Muggleton
to town, as you can do from Gravesend; from which place there is 
a long walk to Cobham.</p>
<p>For abundance of editions the immortal Pickwick can hold its 
own with any modern of its &ldquo;weight, age, and 
size.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the splendid yet unwieldy <i>edition de 
luxe</i>, all but Bible-like in its proportions, to the one penny
edition sold on barrows in Cheapside, every form and pattern has 
been supplied.</p>
<p>The Gadshill Edition, with Introduction by Andrew Lang, has 
recently been issued by Messrs. Chapman and Hall, and is all that
can be desired.&nbsp; Print, paper, and size are excellent, 
perfect, even captivating.&nbsp; The old illustrations, from the 
original plates, are bright and clear, unworn and unclogged with 
ink.&nbsp; The editor has been judiciously reserved in his 
introduction and annotations.&nbsp; While Mr. Lang&rsquo;s lack 
of sympathy with Dickens is well-known, <!-- page 126--><a 
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>and, like 
Sam Weller after leaving the witness-box, he has said just as 
little respecting Mr. Pickwick as might be, &ldquo;which was 
precisely the object he had in view all along.&rdquo;&nbsp; But 
it almost seems as though one required to be &ldquo;brought 
up&rdquo; in Pickwick, so to speak, thoroughly to understand 
him.&nbsp; No true Pickwickian would ever have called Tuckle the 
Bath Footman, &ldquo;Blazer,&rdquo; or Jingle, 
&ldquo;Jungle.&rdquo;&nbsp; It were better, too, not to adopt a 
carping tone in dealing with so joyous and irresponsible a 
work.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dickens,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;knew 
nothing of cricket.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet in his prime the present 
writer has seen him &ldquo;marking&rdquo; all day long, or acting
as umpire, with extraordinary knowledge and enthusiasm.&nbsp; In 
Pickwickian days the game was not what it is now; it was always 
more or less irregular and disorderly.&nbsp; As proof of 
&ldquo;Boz&rsquo;s&rdquo; ignorance, Mr. Lang says it is a 
mystery why Podder &ldquo;missed the bad balls, blocked the 
doubtful ones, took the good ones, and sent them flying, 
etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely nothing could be plainer.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
127</span>He &ldquo;missed&rdquo;&mdash;that is, did not 
strike&mdash;the balls of which nothing could be made, blocked 
the dangerous ones, and hit the good ones all over the 
field.&nbsp; What more or what better could Dr. Grace do?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The original agreement for &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; I have not 
seen, though it is probably in existence, but there is now being 
shown at the Earl&rsquo;s Court Victorian Era Exhibition a very 
interesting Pickwickian curio.&nbsp; When the last number had 
appeared, a deed was created between the two publishers, Edward 
Chapman and William Hall, giving them increased control over the 
book.&nbsp; It is dated November 18th, 1837, and sets out that 
the property consisted of three shares held by the two publishers
and author.&nbsp; It was contracted that the former should 
purchase for a period of five years the author&rsquo;s third 
share.&nbsp; And it was further stipulated that at the end of 
that term, they, and no one else, should have the benefit of any 
new arrangement.&nbsp; There was <!-- page 128--><a 
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>also an 
arrangement about purchasing the &ldquo;stock,&rdquo; etc., at 
the end of the term.&nbsp; No mention, however, is made of the 
terms or &ldquo;consideration,&rdquo; for which reference is made
to another deed.&nbsp; The whole is commendably short and 
intelligible.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations

SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
